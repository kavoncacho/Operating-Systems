For 484
one 19
hour 10
at 272
least 3
we 444
had 11
maintained 1
a 6799
profound 6
silence 7
while 4
each 1
to 805
any 17
casual 9
observer 3
might 9
have 11
seemed 1
intently 1
and 51
exclusively 1
occupied 1
with 34
the 193
curling 2
eddies 1
of 109
smoke 19
that 11
oppressed 1
the 193
atmosphere 3
of 109
the 193
chamber 10
For 484
myself 1
however 1
I 4330
was 93
mentally 1
discussing 1
certain 5
topics 1
which 2
had 11
formed 1
matter 7
for 484
conversation 8
between 1
us 70
at 272
an 970
earlier 1
period 16
of 109
the 193
evening 3
I 4330
mean 36
the 193
affair 3
of 109
the 193
Rue 8
Morgue 3
and 51
the 193
mystery 2
attending 1
the 193
murder 13
of 109
Marie 4
Rog 18
t 6034
I 4330
looked 1
upon 1
it 67
therefore 1
as 509
something 3
of 109
a 6799
coincidence 3
when 6
the 193
door 41
of 109
our 3
apartment 3
was 93
thrown 1
open 21
and 51
admitted 2
our 3
old 21
acquaintance 5
Monsieur 2
G 4017
the 193
Prefect 6
of 109
the 193
Parisian 3
police 10
We 444
gave 4
him 9
a 6799
hearty 2
welcome 4
for 484
there 21
was 93
nearly 1
half 23
as 509
much 2
of 109
the 193
entertaining 3
as 509
of 109
the 193
contemptible 1
about 1
the 193
man 342
and 51
we 444
had 11
not 85
seen 1
him 9
for 484
several 3
years 1
We 444
had 11
been 1
sitting 3
in 2719
the 193
dark 19
and 51
Dupin 2
now 10
arose 1
for 484
the 193
purpose 12
of 109
lighting 2
a 6799
lamp 24
but 82
sat 92
down 90
again 2
without 1
doing 3
so 797
upon 1
G 4017
's 0
saying 3
that 11
he 962
had 11
called 1
to 805
consult 14
us 70
or 333
rather 2
to 805
ask 6
the 193
opinion 4
of 109
my 90
friend 14
about 1
some 30
official 9
business 13
which 2
had 11
occasioned 1
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
of 109
trouble 18
If 8
it 67
is 124
any 17
point 22
requiring 1
reflection 3
observed 1
Dupin 2
as 509
he 962
forebore 0
to 805
enkindle 0
the 193
wick 17
we 444
shall 12
examine 6
it 67
to 805
better 7
purpose 12
in 2719
the 193
dark 19
That 11
is 124
another 1
of 109
your 4
odd 17
notions 1
said 1
the 193
Prefect 6
who 79
had 11
a 6799
fashion 10
of 109
calling 3
every 10
thing 15
odd 17
that 11
was 93
beyond 1
his 43
comprehension 3
and 51
thus 1
lived 1
amid 5
an 970
absolute 7
legion 9
of 109
oddities 1
Very 1
true 9
said 1
Dupin 2
as 509
he 962
supplied 1
his 43
visiter 0
with 34
a 6799
pipe 14
and 51
rolled 1
towards 1
him 9
a 6799
comfortable 3
chair 20
And 51
what 14
is 124
the 193
difficulty 2
now 10
I 4330
asked 1
Nothing 5
more 11
in 2719
the 193
assassination 3
way 27
I 4330
hope 16
Oh 17
no 896
nothing 5
of 109
that 11
nature 3
The 193
fact 35
is 124
the 193
business 13
is 124
very 1
simple 10
indeed 1
and 51
I 4330
make 17
no 896
doubt 15
that 11
we 444
can 287
manage 15
it 67
sufficiently 1
well 24
ourselves 1
but 82
then 5
I 4330
thought 11
Dupin 2
would 5
like 22
to 805
hear 76
the 193
details 1
of 109
it 67
because 1
it 67
is 124
so 797
excessively 1
odd 17
Simple 10
and 51
odd 17
said 1
Dupin 2
Why 4
yes 16
and 51
not 85
exactly 1
that 11
either 1
The 193
fact 35
is 124
we 444
have 11
all 162
been 1
a 6799
good 28
deal 13
puzzled 1
because 1
the 193
affair 3
is 124
so 797
simple 10
and 51
yet 4
baffles 1
us 70
altogether 1
Perhaps 1
it 67
is 124
the 193
very 1
simplicity 2
of 109
the 193
thing 15
which 2
puts 4
you 29
at 272
fault 20
said 1
my 90
friend 14
What 14
nonsense 2
you 29
do 814
talk 18
replied 1
the 193
Prefect 6
laughing 6
heartily 1
Perhaps 1
the 193
mystery 2
is 124
a 6799
little 6
too 50
plain 27
said 1
Dupin 2
Oh 17
good 28
heavens 2
who 79
ever 33
heard 1
of 109
such 2
an 970
idea 21
A 6799
little 6
too 50
self 11
evident 2

our 3

profoundly 1
amused 1
oh 17
Dupin 2
you 29
will 39
be 1200
the 193
death 19
of 109
me 1041
yet 4
And 51
what 14
after 48
all 162
is 124
the 193
matter 7
on 86
hand 137
I 4330
asked 1
Why 4
I 4330
will 39
tell 16
you 29
replied 1
the 193
Prefect 6
as 509
he 962
gave 4
a 6799
long 49
steady 3
and 51
contemplative 4
puff 19
and 51
settled 1
himself 1
in 2719
his 43
chair 20
I 4330
will 39
tell 16
you 29
in 2719
a 6799
few 6
words 5
but 82
before 2
I 4330
begin 8
let 50
me 1041
caution 6
you 29
that 11
this 6
is 124
an 970
affair 3
demanding 1
the 193
greatest 1
secrecy 2
and 51
that 11
I 4330
should 7
most 3
probably 1
lose 5
the 193
position 6
I 4330
now 10
hold 22
were 5
it 67
known 1
that 11
I 4330
confided 1
it 67
to 805
any 17
one 19
Proceed 7
said 1
I 4330
Or 333
not 85
said 1
Dupin 2
Well 24
then 5
I 4330
have 11
received 1
personal 13
information 3
from 2
a 6799
very 1
high 54
quarter 25
that 11
a 6799
certain 5
document 11
of 109
the 193
last 7
importance 2
has 41
been 1
purloined 1
from 2
the 193
royal 11
apartments 1
The 193
individual 19
who 79
purloined 1
it 67
is 124
known 1
this 6
beyond 1
a 6799
doubt 15
he 962
was 93
seen 1
to 805
take 18
it 67
It 67
is 124
known 1
also 3
that 11
it 67
still 13
remains 1
in 2719
his 43
possession 3
How 27
is 124
this 6
known 1
asked 1
Dupin 2
It 67
is 124
clearly 1
inferred 1
replied 1
the 193
Prefect 6
from 2
the 193
nature 3
of 109
the 193
document 11
and 51
from 2
the 193
non 424
appearance 3
of 109
certain 5
results 1
which 2
would 5
at 272
once 2
arise 3
from 2
its 2
passing 3
out 365
of 109
the 193
robber's 1
possession 3
that 11
is 124
to 805
say 7
from 2
his 43
employing 1
it 67
as 509
he 962
must 28
design 16
in 2719
the 193
end 92
to 805
employ 15
it 67
Be 1200
a 6799
little 6
more 11
explicit 4
I 4330
said 1
Well 24
I 4330
may 49
venture 8
so 797
far 91
as 509
to 805
say 7
that 11
the 193
paper 35
gives 1
its 2
holder 3
a 6799
certain 5
power 19
in 2719
a 6799
certain 5
quarter 25
where 21
such 2
power 19
is 124
immensely 1
valuable 3
The 193
Prefect 6
was 93
fond 17
of 109
the 193
cant 54
of 109
diplomacy 2
Still 13
I 4330
do 814
not 85
quite 1
understand 8
said 1
Dupin 2
No 896
Well 24
the 193
disclosure 3
of 109
the 193
document 11
to 805
a 6799
third 4
person 33
who 79
shall 12
be 1200
nameless 2
would 5
bring 6
in 2719
question 16
the 193
honor 23
of 109
a 6799
personage 3
of 109
most 3
exalted 1
station 13
and 51
this 6
fact 35
gives 1
the 193
holder 3
of 109
the 193
document 11
an 970
ascendancy 2
over 596
the 193
illustrious 4
personage 3
whose 1
honor 23
and 51
peace 21
are 12
so 797
jeopardized 1
But 82
this 6
ascendancy 2
I 4330
interposed 1
would 5
depend 17
upon 1
the 193
robber's 1
knowledge 4
of 109
the 193
loser's 1
knowledge 4
of 109
the 193
robber 6
Who 79
would 5
dare 15
The 193
thief 2
said 1
G 4017
is 124
the 193
Minister 6
D 6926
who 79
dares 2
all 162
things 1
those 1
unbecoming 2
as 509
well 24
as 509
those 1
becoming 2
a 6799
man 342
The 193
method 18
of 109
the 193
theft 3
was 93
not 85
less 19
ingenious 4
than 22
bold 9
The 193
document 11
in 2719
question 16
a 6799
letter 20
to 805
be 1200
frank 26
had 11
been 1
received 1
by 57
the 193
personage 3
robbed 1
while 4
alone 1
in 2719
the 193
royal 11
boudoir 3
During 1
its 2
perusal 3
she 199
was 93
suddenly 1
interrupted 1
by 57
the 193
entrance 6
of 109
the 193
other 5
exalted 1
personage 3
from 2
whom 3
especially 1
it 67
was 93
her 181
wish 13
to 805
conceal 10
it 67
After 48
a 6799
hurried 2
and 51
vain 8
endeavor 5
to 805
thrust 4
it 67
in 2719
a 6799
drawer 3
she 199
was 93
forced 1
to 805
place 29
it 67
open 21
as 509
it 67
was 93
upon 1
a 6799
table 27
The 193
address 9
however 1
was 93
uppermost 1
and 51
the 193
contents 1
thus 1
unexposed 1
the 193
letter 20
escaped 1
notice 8
At 272
this 6
juncture 3
enters 1
the 193
Minister 6
D 6926
His 43
lynx 3
eye 57
immediately 1
perceives 1
the 193
paper 35
recognises 0
the 193
handwriting 2
of 109
the 193
address 9
observes 1
the 193
confusion 3
of 109
the 193
personage 3
addressed 1
and 51
fathoms 1
her 181
secret 25
After 48
some 30
business 13
transactions 1
hurried 2
through 4
in 2719
his 43
ordinary 2
manner 8
he 962
produces 1
a 6799
letter 20
somewhat 2
similar 5
to 805
the 193
one 19
in 2719
question 16
opens 1
it 67
pretends 1
to 805
read 49
it 67
and 51
then 5
places 1
it 67
in 2719
close 22
juxtaposition 3
to 805
the 193
other 5
Again 2
he 962
converses 1
for 484
some 30
fifteen 6
minutes 2
upon 1
the 193
public 18
affairs 1
At 272
length 14
in 2719
taking 4
leave 14
he 962
takes 1
also 3
from 2
the 193
table 27
the 193
letter 20
to 805
which 2
he 962
had 11
no 896
claim 12
Its 2
rightful 4
owner 5
saw 24
but 82
of 109
course 10
dared 6
not 85
call 57
attention 3
to 805
the 193
act 69
in 2719
the 193
presence 3
of 109
the 193
third 4
personage 3
who 79
stood 1
at 272
her 181
elbow 7
The 193
minister 6
decamped 1
leaving 3
his 43
own 9
letter 20
one 19
of 109
no 896
importance 2
upon 1
the 193
table 27
Here 31
then 5
said 1
Dupin 2
to 805
me 1041
you 29
have 11
precisely 1
what 14
you 29
demand 5
to 805
make 17
the 193
ascendancy 2
complete 8
the 193
robber's 1
knowledge 4
of 109
the 193
loser's 1
knowledge 4
of 109
the 193
robber 6
Yes 16
replied 1
the 193
Prefect 6
and 51
the 193
power 19
thus 1
attained 1
has 41
for 484
some 30
months 1
past 71
been 1
wielded 1
for 484
political 2
purposes 1
to 805
a 6799
very 1
dangerous 2
extent 3
The 193
personage 3
robbed 1
is 124
more 11
thoroughly 1
convinced 1
every 10
day 27
of 109
the 193
necessity 2
of 109
reclaiming 1
her 181
letter 20
But 82
this 6
of 109
course 10
cannot 1
be 1200
done 3
openly 1
In 2719
fine 17
driven 1
to 805
despair 6
she 199
has 41
committed 1
the 193
matter 7
to 805
me 1041
Than 22
whom 3
said 1
Dupin 2
amid 5
a 6799
perfect 24
whirlwind 3
of 109
smoke 19
no 896
more 11
sagacious 2
agent 3
could 2
I 4330
suppose 4
be 1200
desired 1
or 333
even 36
imagined 1
You 29
flatter 10
me 1041
replied 1
the 193
Prefect 6
but 82
it 67
is 124
possible 3
that 11
some 30
such 2
opinion 4
may 49
have 11
been 1
entertained 1
It 67
is 124
clear 23
said 1
I 4330
as 509
you 29
observe 6
that 11
the 193
letter 20
is 124
still 13
in 2719
possession 3
of 109
the 193
minister 6
since 7
it 67
is 124
this 6
possession 3
and 51
not 85
any 17
employment 3
of 109
the 193
letter 20
which 2
bestows 1
the 193
power 19
With 34
the 193
employment 3
the 193
power 19
departs 1
True 9
said 1
G 4017
and 51
upon 1
this 6
conviction 3
I 4330
proceeded 1
My 90
first 8
care 47
was 93
to 805
make 17
thorough 13
search 12
of 109
the 193
minister's 1
hotel 6
and 51
here 31
my 90
chief 14
embarrassment 3
lay 42
in 2719
the 193
necessity 2
of 109
searching 2
without 1
his 43
knowledge 4
Beyond 1
all 162
things 1
I 4330
have 11
been 1
warned 1
of 109
the 193
danger 7
which 2
would 5
result 8
from 2
giving 2
him 9
reason 13
to 805
suspect 5
our 3
design 16
But 82
said 1
I 4330
you 29
are 12
quite 1
au 348
fait 14
in 2719
these 4
investigations 1
The 193
Parisian 3
police 10
have 11
done 3
this 6
thing 15
often 4
before 2
O 2809
yes 16
and 51
for 484
this 6
reason 13
I 4330
did 23
not 85
despair 6
The 193
habits 1
of 109
the 193
minister 6
gave 4
me 1041
too 50
a 6799
great 12
advantage 6
He 962
is 124
frequently 1
absent 14
from 2
home 90
all 162
night 61
His 43
servants 1
are 12
by 57
no 896
means 1
numerous 2
They 5
sleep 33
at 272
a 6799
distance 4
from 2
their 2
master's 1
apartment 3
and 51
being 3
chiefly 1
Neapolitans 0
are 12
readily 1
made 13
drunk 12
I 4330
have 11
keys 7
as 509
you 29
know 12
with 34
which 2
I 4330
can 287
open 21
any 17
chamber 10
or 333
cabinet 12
in 2719
Paris 11
For 484
three 12
months 1
a 6799
night 61
has 41
not 85
passed 1
during 1
the 193
greater 1
part 102
of 109
which 2
I 4330
have 11
not 85
been 1
engaged 1
personally 1
in 2719
ransacking 1
the 193
D 6926
Hotel 6
My 90
honor 23
is 124
interested 1
and 51
to 805
mention 5
a 6799
great 12
secret 25
the 193
reward 5
is 124
enormous 4
So 797
I 4330
did 23
not 85
abandon 6
the 193
search 12
until 1
I 4330
had 11
become 2
fully 1
satisfied 1
that 11
the 193
thief 2
is 124
a 6799
more 11
astute 6
man 342
than 22
myself 1
I 4330
fancy 5
that 11
I 4330
have 11
investigated 1
every 10
nook 5
and 51
corner 8
of 109
the 193
premises 1
in 2719
which 2
it 67
is 124
possible 3
that 11
the 193
paper 35
can 287
be 1200
concealed 1
But 82
is 124
it 67
not 85
possible 3
I 4330
suggested 1
that 11
although 1
the 193
letter 20
may 49
be 1200
in 2719
possession 3
of 109
the 193
minister 6
as 509
it 67
unquestionably 1
is 124
he 962
may 49
have 11
concealed 1
it 67
elsewhere 1
than 22
upon 1
his 43
own 9
premises 1
This 6
is 124
barely 1
possible 3
said 1
Dupin 2
The 193
present 20
peculiar 5
condition 13
of 109
affairs 1
at 272
court 37
and 51
especially 1
of 109
those 1
intrigues 1
in 2719
which 2
D 6926
is 124
known 1
to 805
be 1200
involved 1
would 5
render 7
the 193
instant 11
availability 2
of 109
the 193
document 11
its 2
susceptibility 2
of 109
being 3
produced 1
at 272
a 6799
moment's 1
notice 8
a 6799
point 22
of 109
nearly 1
equal 17
importance 2
with 34
its 2
possession 3
Its 2
susceptibility 2
of 109
being 3
produced 1
said 1
I 4330
That 11
is 124
to 805
say 7
of 109
being 3
destroyed 1
said 1
Dupin 2
True 9
I 4330
observed 1
the 193
paper 35
is 124
clearly 1
then 5
upon 1
the 193
premises 1
As 509
for 484
its 2
being 3
upon 1
the 193
person 33
of 109
the 193
minister 6
we 444
may 49
consider 13
that 11
as 509
out 365
of 109
the 193
question 16
Entirely 1
said 1
the 193
Prefect 6
He 962
has 41
been 1
twice 1
waylaid 1
as 509
if 8
by 57
footpads 0
and 51
his 43
person 33
rigorously 1
searched 1
under 288
my 90
own 9
inspection 3
You 29
might 9
have 11
spared 1
yourself 1
this 6
trouble 18
said 1
Dupin 2
D 6926
I 4330
presume 3
is 124
not 85
altogether 1
a 6799
fool 21
and 51
if 8
not 85
must 28
have 11
anticipated 1
these 4
waylayings 0
as 509
a 6799
matter 7
of 109
course 10
Not 85
altogether 1
a 6799
fool 21
said 1
G 4017
but 82
then 5
he's 1
a 6799
poet 14
which 2
I 4330
take 18
to 805
be 1200
only 1
one 19
remove 7
from 2
a 6799
fool 21
True 9
said 1
Dupin 2
after 48
a 6799
long 49
and 51
thoughtful 4
whiff 8
from 2
his 43
meerschaum 3
although 1
I 4330
have 11
been 1
guilty 1
of 109
certain 5
doggrel 0
myself 1
Suppose 4
you 29
detail 5
said 1
I 4330
the 193
particulars 1
of 109
your 4
search 12
Why 4
the 193
fact 35
is 124
we 444
took 1
our 3
time 45
and 51
we 444
searched 1
every 10
where 21
I 4330
have 11
had 11
long 49
experience 4
in 2719
these 4
affairs 1
I 4330
took 1
the 193
entire 4
building 3
room 22
by 57
room 22
devoting 1
the 193
nights 16
of 109
a 6799
whole 26
week 20
to 805
each 1
We 444
examined 1
first 8
the 193
furniture 2
of 109
each 1
apartment 3
We 444
opened 1
every 10
possible 3
drawer 3
and 51
I 4330
presume 3
you 29
know 12
that 11
to 805
a 6799
properly 1
trained 1
police 10
agent 3
such 2
a 6799
thing 15
as 509
a 6799
secret 25
drawer 3
is 124
impossible 2
Any 17
man 342
is 124
a 6799
dolt 7
who 79
permits 1
a 6799
'secret' 0
drawer 3
to 805
escape 10
him 9
in 2719
a 6799
search 12
of 109
this 6
kind 31
The 193
thing 15
is 124
so 797
plain 27
There 21
is 124
a 6799
certain 5
amount 5
of 109
bulk 13
of 109
space 34
to 805
be 1200
accounted 1
for 484
in 2719
every 10
cabinet 12
Then 5
we 444
have 11
accurate 4
rules 1
The 193
fiftieth 3
part 102
of 109
a 6799
line 36
could 2
not 85
escape 10
us 70
After 48
the 193
cabinets 1
we 444
took 1
the 193
chairs 1
The 193
cushions 1
we 444
probed 1
with 34
the 193
fine 17
long 49
needles 5
you 29
have 11
seen 1
me 1041
employ 15
From 2
the 193
tables 7
we 444
removed 1
the 193
tops 13
Why 4
so 797
Sometimes 1
the 193
top 71
of 109
a 6799
table 27
or 333
other 5
similarly 1
arranged 1
piece 10
of 109
furniture 2
is 124
removed 1
by 57
the 193
person 33
wishing 1
to 805
conceal 10
an 970
article 4
then 5
the 193
leg 125
is 124
excavated 1
the 193
article 4
deposited 1
within 3
the 193
cavity 2
and 51
the 193
top 71
replaced 1
The 193
bottoms 1
and 51
tops 13
of 109
bedposts 1
are 12
employed 1
in 2719
the 193
same 5
way 27
But 82
could 2
not 85
the 193
cavity 2
be 1200
detected 1
by 57
sounding 3
I 4330
asked 1
By 57
no 896
means 1
if 8
when 6
the 193
article 4
is 124
deposited 1
a 6799
sufficient 2
wadding 2
of 109
cotton 18
be 1200
placed 1
around 1
it 67
Besides 1
in 2719
our 3
case 25
we 444
were 5
obliged 1
to 805
proceed 7
without 1
noise 11
But 82
you 29
could 2
not 85
have 11
removed 1
you 29
could 2
not 85
have 11
taken 1
to 805
pieces 1
all 162
articles 1
of 109
furniture 2
in 2719
which 2
it 67
would 5
have 11
been 1
possible 3
to 805
make 17
a 6799
deposit 14
in 2719
the 193
manner 8
you 29
mention 5
A 6799
letter 20
may 49
be 1200
compressed 1
into 26
a 6799
thin 35
spiral 6
roll 28
not 85
differing 1
much 2
in 2719
shape 13
or 333
bulk 13
from 2
a 6799
large 11
knitting 2
needle 15
and 51
in 2719
this 6
form 68
it 67
might 9
be 1200
inserted 1
into 26
the 193
rung 3
of 109
a 6799
chair 20
for 484
example 4
You 29
did 23
not 85
take 18
to 805
pieces 1
all 162
the 193
chairs 1
Certainly 1
not 85
but 82
we 444
did 23
better 7
we 444
examined 1
the 193
rungs 1
of 109
every 10
chair 20
in 2719
the 193
hotel 6
and 51
indeed 1
the 193
jointings 0
of 109
every 10
description 3
of 109
furniture 2
by 57
the 193
aid 12
of 109
a 6799
most 3
powerful 2
microscope 3
Had 11
there 21
been 1
any 17
traces 1
of 109
recent 6
disturbance 3
we 444
should 7
not 85
have 11
failed 1
to 805
detect 13
it 67
instantly 1
A 6799
single 15
grain 9
of 109
gimlet 5
dust 31
for 484
example 4
would 5
have 11
been 1
as 509
obvious 4
as 509
an 970
apple 12
Any 17
disorder 8
in 2719
the 193
glueing 0
any 17
unusual 2
gaping 1
in 2719
the 193
joints 1
would 5
have 11
sufficed 1
to 805
insure 8
detection 2
I 4330
presume 3
you 29
looked 1
to 805
the 193
mirrors 1
between 1
the 193
boards 1
and 51
the 193
plates 1
and 51
you 29
probed 1
the 193
beds 17
and 51
the 193
bed 93
clothes 10
as 509
well 24
as 509
the 193
curtains 1
and 51
carpets 1
That 11
of 109
course 10
and 51
when 6
we 444
had 11
absolutely 1
completed 1
every 10
particle 5
of 109
the 193
furniture 2
in 2719
this 6
way 27
then 5
we 444
examined 1
the 193
house 87
itself 1
We 444
divided 1
its 2
entire 4
surface 4
into 26
compartments 1
which 2
we 444
numbered 1
so 797
that 11
none 32
might 9
be 1200
missed 1
then 5
we 444
scrutinized 1
each 1
individual 19
square 9
inch 11
throughout 1
the 193
premises 1
including 1
the 193
two 14
houses 1
immediately 1
adjoining 1
with 34
the 193
microscope 3
as 509
before 2
The 193
two 14
houses 1
adjoining 1
I 4330
exclaimed 1
you 29
must 28
have 11
had 11
a 6799
great 12
deal 13
of 109
trouble 18
We 444
had 11
but 82
the 193
reward 5
offered 1
is 124
prodigious 2
You 29
include 3
the 193
grounds 10
about 1
the 193
houses 1
All 162
the 193
grounds 10
are 12
paved 1
with 34
brick 19
They 5
gave 4
us 70
comparatively 1
little 6
trouble 18
We 444
examined 1
the 193
moss 9
between 1
the 193
bricks 1
and 51
found 18
it 67
undisturbed 1
You 29
looked 1
among 1
D 6926
's 0
papers 1
of 109
course 10
and 51
into 26
the 193
books 15
of 109
the 193
library 2
Certainly 1
we 444
opened 1
every 10
package 7
and 51
parcel 5
we 444
not 85
only 1
opened 1
every 10
book 69
but 82
we 444
turned 1
over 596
every 10
leaf 19
in 2719
each 1
volume 3
not 85
contenting 1
ourselves 1
with 34
a 6799
mere 10
shake 19
according 2
to 805
the 193
fashion 10
of 109
some 30
of 109
our 3
police 10
officers 1
We 444
also 3
measured 1
the 193
thickness 3
of 109
every 10
book 69
cover 21
with 34
the 193
most 3
accurate 4
admeasurement 0
and 51
applied 1
to 805
each 1
the 193
most 3
jealous 5
scrutiny 2
of 109
the 193
microscope 3
Had 11
any 17
of 109
the 193
bindings 1
been 1
recently 1
meddled 1
with 34
it 67
would 5
have 11
been 1
utterly 1
impossible 2
that 11
the 193
fact 35
should 7
have 11
escaped 1
observation 4
Some 30
five 5
or 333
six 24
volumes 1
just 24
from 2
the 193
hands 24
of 109
the 193
binder 6
we 444
carefully 1
probed 1
longitudinally 1
with 34
the 193
needles 5
You 29
explored 1
the 193
floors 1
beneath 1
the 193
carpets 1
Beyond 1
doubt 15
We 444
removed 1
every 10
carpet 14
and 51
examined 1
the 193
boards 1
with 34
the 193
microscope 3
And 51
the 193
paper 35
on 86
the 193
walls 1
Yes 16
You 29
looked 1
into 26
the 193
cellars 1
We 444
did 23
Then 5
I 4330
said 1
you 29
have 11
been 1
making 4
a 6799
miscalculation 3
and 51
the 193
letter 20
is 124
not 85
upon 1
the 193
premises 1
as 509
you 29
suppose 4
I 4330
fear 14
you 29
are 12
right 31
there 21
said 1
the 193
Prefect 6
And 51
now 10
Dupin 2
what 14
would 5
you 29
advise 9
me 1041
to 805
do 814
To 805
make 17
a 6799
thorough 13
re 3833
search 12
of 109
the 193
premises 1
That 11
is 124
absolutely 1
needless 4
replied 1
G 4017
I 4330
am 392
not 85
more 11
sure 11
that 11
I 4330
breathe 6
than 22
I 4330
am 392
that 11
the 193
letter 20
is 124
not 85
at 272
the 193
Hotel 6
I 4330
have 11
no 896
better 7
advice 2
to 805
give 15
you 29
said 1
Dupin 2
You 29
have 11
of 109
course 10
an 970
accurate 4
description 3
of 109
the 193
letter 20
Oh 17
yes 16
And 51
here 31
the 193
Prefect 6
producing 1
a 6799
memorandum 3
book 69
proceeded 1
to 805
read 49
aloud 1
a 6799
minute 12
account 14
of 109
the 193
internal 9
and 51
especially 1
of 109
the 193
external 11
appearance 3
of 109
the 193
missing 1
document 11
Soon 3
after 48
finishing 1
the 193
perusal 3
of 109
this 6
description 3
he 962
took 1
his 43
departure 3
more 11
entirely 1
depressed 1
in 2719
spirits 1
than 22
I 4330
had 11
ever 33
known 1
the 193
good 28
gentleman 3
before 2
In 2719
about 1
a 6799
month 6
afterwards 1
he 962
paid 1
us 70
another 1
visit 14
and 51
found 18
us 70
occupied 1
very 1
nearly 1
as 509
before 2
He 962
took 1
a 6799
pipe 14
and 51
a 6799
chair 20
and 51
entered 1
into 26
some 30
ordinary 2
conversation 8
At 272
length 14
I 4330
said 1
Well 24
but 82
G 4017
what 14
of 109
the 193
purloined 1
letter 20
I 4330
presume 3
you 29
have 11
at 272
last 7
made 13
up 194
your 4
mind 25
that 11
there 21
is 124
no 896
such 2
thing 15
as 509
overreaching 1
the 193
Minister 6
Confound 4
him 9
say 7
I 4330
yes 16
I 4330
made 13
the 193
re 3833
examination 3
however 1
as 509
Dupin 2
suggested 1
but 82
it 67
was 93
all 162
labor 16
lost 1
as 509
I 4330
knew 1
it 67
would 5
be 1200
How 27
much 2
was 93
the 193
reward 5
offered 1
did 23
you 29
say 7
asked 1
Dupin 2
Why 4
a 6799
very 1
great 12
deal 13
a 6799
very 1
liberal 17
reward 5
I 4330
don't 1
like 22
to 805
say 7
how 27
much 2
precisely 1
but 82
one 19
thing 15
I 4330
will 39
say 7
that 11
I 4330
wouldn't 1
mind 25
giving 2
my 90
individual 19
check 40
for 484
fifty 2
thousand 7
francs 1
to 805
any 17
one 19
who 79
could 2
obtain 7
me 1041
that 11
letter 20
The 193
fact 35
is 124
it 67
is 124
becoming 2
of 109
more 11
and 51
more 11
importance 2
every 10
day 27
and 51
the 193
reward 5
has 41
been 1
lately 1
doubled 3
If 8
it 67
were 5
trebled 1
however 1
I 4330
could 2
do 814
no 896
more 11
than 22
I 4330
have 11
done 3
Why 4
yes 16
said 1
Dupin 2
drawlingly 0
between 1
the 193
whiffs 1
of 109
his 43
meerschaum 3
I 4330
really 1
think 8
G 4017
you 29
have 11
not 85
exerted 1
yourself 1
to 805
the 193
utmost 2
in 2719
this 6
matter 7
You 29
might 9
do 814
a 6799
little 6
more 11
I 4330
think 8
eh 4
How 27
in 2719
what 14
way 27
' 0
Why 4
puff 19
puff 19
you 29
might 9
puff 19
puff 19
employ 15
counsel 9
in 2719
the 193
matter 7
eh 4
puff 19
puff 19
puff 19
Do 814
you 29
remember 4
the 193
story 13
they 5
tell 16
of 109
Abernethy 0
No 896
hang 33
Abernethy 0
To 805
be 1200
sure 11
hang 33
him 9
and 51
welcome 4
But 82
once 2
upon 1
a 6799
time 45
a 6799
certain 5
rich 19
miser 13
conceived 1
the 193
design 16
of 109
spunging 0
upon 1
this 6
Abernethy 0
for 484
a 6799
medical 4
opinion 4
Getting 1
up 194
for 484
this 6
purpose 12
an 970
ordinary 2
conversation 8
in 2719
a 6799
private 9
company 2
he 962
insinuated 1
his 43
case 25
to 805
the 193
physician 3
as 509
that 11
of 109
an 970
imaginary 1
individual 19
'We 0
will 39
suppose 4
' 0
said 1
the 193
miser 13
'that 0
his 43
symptoms 1
are 12
such 2
and 51
such 2
now 10
doctor 11
what 14
would 5
you 29
have 11
directed 1
him 9
to 805
take 18
' 0
'Take 0
' 0
said 1
Abernethy 0
'why 0
take 18
advice 2
to 805
be 1200
sure 11
' 0
But 82
said 1
the 193
Prefect 6
a 6799
little 6
discomposed 1
I 4330
am 392
perfectly 1
willing 4
to 805
take 18
advice 2
and 51
to 805
pay 52
for 484
it 67
I 4330
would 5
really 1
give 15
fifty 2
thousand 7
francs 1
to 805
any 17
one 19
who 79
would 5
aid 12
me 1041
in 2719
the 193
matter 7
In 2719
that 11
case 25
replied 1
Dupin 2
opening 3
a 6799
drawer 3
and 51
producing 1
a 6799
check 40
book 69
you 29
may 49
as 509
well 24
fill 25
me 1041
up 194
a 6799
check 40
for 484
the 193
amount 5
mentioned 1
When 6
you 29
have 11
signed 1
it 67
I 4330
will 39
hand 137
you 29
the 193
letter 20
I 4330
was 93
astounded 1
The 193
Prefect 6
appeared 1
absolutely 1
thunder 32
stricken 1
For 484
some 30
minutes 2
he 962
remained 1
speechless 4
and 51
motionless 4
looking 1
incredulously 1
at 272
my 90
friend 14
with 34
open 21
mouth 22
and 51
eyes 8
that 11
seemed 1
starting 1
from 2
their 2
sockets 1
then 5
apparently 1
recovering 1
himself 1
in 2719
some 30
measure 8
he 962
seized 1
a 6799
pen 195
and 51
after 48
several 3
pauses 1
and 51
vacant 2
stares 1
finally 1
filled 1
up 194
and 51
signed 1
a 6799
check 40
for 484
fifty 2
thousand 7
francs 1
and 51
handed 2
it 67
across 1
the 193
table 27
to 805
Dupin 2
The 193
latter 3
examined 1
it 67
carefully 1
and 51
deposited 1
it 67
in 2719
his 43
pocket 14
book 69
then 5
unlocking 1
an 970
escritoire 3
took 1
thence 3
a 6799
letter 20
and 51
gave 4
it 67
to 805
the 193
Prefect 6
This 6
functionary 2
grasped 1
it 67
in 2719
a 6799
perfect 24
agony 2
of 109
joy 36
opened 1
it 67
with 34
a 6799
trembling 1
hand 137
cast 54
a 6799
rapid 10
glance 4
at 272
its 2
contents 1
and 51
then 5
scrambling 1
and 51
struggling 1
to 805
the 193
door 41
rushed 1
at 272
length 14
unceremoniously 1
from 2
the 193
room 22
and 51
from 2
the 193
house 87
without 1
having 1
uttered 1
a 6799
syllable 3
since 7
Dupin 2
had 11
requested 1
him 9
to 805
fill 25
up 194
the 193
check 40
When 6
he 962
had 11
gone 4
my 90
friend 14
entered 1
into 26
some 30
explanations 1
The 193
Parisian 3
police 10
he 962
said 1
are 12
exceedingly 1
able 3
in 2719
their 2
way 27
They 5
are 12
persevering 1
ingenious 4
cunning 7
and 51
thoroughly 1
versed 1
in 2719
the 193
knowledge 4
which 2
their 2
duties 1
seem 10
chiefly 1
to 805
demand 5
Thus 1
when 6
G 4017
detailed 1
to 805
us 70
his 43
mode 57
of 109
searching 2
the 193
premises 1
at 272
the 193
Hotel 6
D 6926
I 4330
felt 5
entire 4
confidence 3
in 2719
his 43
having 1
made 13
a 6799
satisfactory 1
investigation 3
so 797
far 91
as 509
his 43
labors 2
extended 1
So 797
far 91
as 509
his 43
labors 2
extended 1
said 1
I 4330
Yes 16
said 1
Dupin 2
The 193
measures 1
adopted 1
were 5
not 85
only 1
the 193
best 37
of 109
their 2
kind 31
but 82
carried 1
out 365
to 805
absolute 7
perfection 8
Had 11
the 193
letter 20
been 1
deposited 1
within 3
the 193
range 9
of 109
their 2
search 12
these 4
fellows 4
would 5
beyond 1
a 6799
question 16
have 11
found 18
it 67
I 4330
merely 1
laughed 1
but 82
he 962
seemed 1
quite 1
serious 4
in 2719
all 162
that 11
he 962
said 1
The 193
measures 1
then 5
he 962
continued 1
were 5
good 28
in 2719
their 2
kind 31
and 51
well 24
executed 1
their 2
defect 17
lay 42
in 2719
their 2
being 3
inapplicable 1
to 805
the 193
case 25
and 51
to 805
the 193
man 342
A 6799
certain 5
set 40
of 109
highly 1
ingenious 4
resources 1
are 12
with 34
the 193
Prefect 6
a 6799
sort 14
of 109
Procrustean 1
bed 93
to 805
which 2
he 962
forcibly 1
adapts 1
his 43
designs 1
But 82
he 962
perpetually 1
errs 1
by 57
being 3
too 50
deep 12
or 333
too 50
shallow 8
for 484
the 193
matter 7
in 2719
hand 137
and 51
many 2
a 6799
schoolboy 3
is 124
a 6799
better 7
reasoner 3
than 22
he 962
I 4330
knew 1
one 19
about 1
eight 18
years 1
of 109
age 24
whose 1
success 13
at 272
guessing 1
in 2719
the 193
game 24
of 109
'even 0
and 51
odd' 0
attracted 1
universal 10
admiration 2
This 6
game 24
is 124
simple 10
and 51
is 124
played 1
with 34
marbles 1
One 19
player 3
holds 1
in 2719
his 43
hand 137
a 6799
number 8
of 109
these 4
toys 1
and 51
demands 1
of 109
another 1
whether 1
that 11
number 8
is 124
even 36
or 333
odd 17
If 8
the 193
guess 16
is 124
right 31
the 193
guesser 3
wins 9
one 19
if 8
wrong 24
he 962
loses 1
one 19
The 193
boy 25
to 805
whom 3
I 4330
allude 3
won 33
all 162
the 193
marbles 1
of 109
the 193
school 54
Of 109
course 10
he 962
had 11
some 30
principle 4
of 109
guessing 1
and 51
this 6
lay 42
in 2719
mere 10
observation 4
and 51
admeasurement 0
of 109
the 193
astuteness 2
of 109
his 43
opponents 1
For 484
example 4
an 970
arrant 1
simpleton 3
is 124
his 43
opponent 3
and 51
holding 3
up 194
his 43
closed 1
hand 137
asks 1
'are 0
they 5
even 36
or 333
odd 17
' 0
Our 3
schoolboy 3
replies 1
'odd 0
' 0
and 51
loses 1
but 82
upon 1
the 193
second 16
trial 5
he 962
wins 9
for 484
he 962
then 5
says 1
to 805
himself 1
'the 0
simpleton 3
had 11
them 9
even 36
upon 1
the 193
first 8
trial 5
and 51
his 43
amount 5
of 109
cunning 7
is 124
just 24
sufficient 2
to 805
make 17
him 9
have 11
them 9
odd 17
upon 1
the 193
second 16
I 4330
will 39
therefore 1
guess 16
odd 17
' 0
he 962
guesses 1
odd 17
and 51
wins 9
Now 10
with 34
a 6799
simpleton 3
a 6799
degree 3
above 3
the 193
first 8
he 962
would 5
have 11
reasoned 1
thus 1
'This 0
fellow 9
finds 1
that 11
in 2719
the 193
first 8
instance 4
I 4330
guessed 1
odd 17
and 51
in 2719
the 193
second 16
he 962
will 39
propose 6
to 805
himself 1
upon 1
the 193
first 8
impulse 4
a 6799
simple 10
variation 3
from 2
even 36
to 805
odd 17
as 509
did 23
the 193
first 8
simpleton 3
but 82
then 5
a 6799
second 16
thought 11
will 39
suggest 15
that 11
this 6
is 124
too 50
simple 10
a 6799
variation 3
and 51
finally 1
he 962
will 39
decide 6
upon 1
putting 1
it 67
even 36
as 509
before 2
I 4330
will 39
therefore 1
guess 16
even 36
' 0
he 962
guesses 1
even 36
and 51
wins 9
Now 10
this 6
mode 57
of 109
reasoning 2
in 2719
the 193
schoolboy 3
whom 3
his 43
fellows 4
termed 1
'lucky 0
' 0
what 14
in 2719
its 2
last 7
analysis 2
is 124
it 67
It 67
is 124
merely 1
I 4330
said 1
an 970
identification 3
of 109
the 193
reasoner's 1
intellect 13
with 34
that 11
of 109
his 43
opponent 3
It 67
is 124
said 1
Dupin 2
and 51
upon 1
inquiring 2
of 109
the 193
boy 25
by 57
what 14
means 1
he 962
effected 1
the 193
thorough 13
identification 3
in 2719
which 2
his 43
success 13
consisted 1
I 4330
received 1
answer 8
as 509
follows 1
'When 0
I 4330
wish 13
to 805
find 10
out 365
how 27
wise 17
or 333
how 27
stupid 9
or 333
how 27
good 28
or 333
how 27
wicked 6
is 124
any 17
one 19
or 333
what 14
are 12
his 43
thoughts 1
at 272
the 193
moment 14
I 4330
fashion 10
the 193
expression 11
of 109
my 90
face 19
as 509
accurately 1
as 509
possible 3
in 2719
accordance 2
with 34
the 193
expression 11
of 109
his 43
and 51
then 5
wait 19
to 805
see 70
what 14
thoughts 1
or 333
sentiments 1
arise 3
in 2719
my 90
mind 25
or 333
heart 57
as 509
if 8
to 805
match 25
or 333
correspond 11
with 34
the 193
expression 11
' 0
This 6
response 3
of 109
the 193
schoolboy 3
lies 1
at 272
the 193
bottom 6
of 109
all 162
the 193
spurious 4
profundity 2
which 2
has 41
been 1
attributed 1
to 805
Rochefoucault 0
to 805
La 977
Bougive 0
to 805
Machiavelli 3
and 51
to 805
Campanella 2
And 51
the 193
identification 3

said 1
of 109
the 193
reasoner's 1
intellect 13
with 34
that 11
of 109

understand 8
you 29
aright 1
upon 1

accuracy 2

admeasured 0
For 484
its 2
practical 7
value 8
it 67
depends 1
upon 1

replied 1
Dupin 2
and 51
the 193
Prefect 6
and 51
his 43
cohort 3
fail 12
so 797
frequently 1
first 8
by 57
default 8
of 109
this 6
identification 3
and 51
secondly 1
by 57
ill 84
admeasurement 0

rather 2
through 4
non 424
admeasurement 0
of 109
the 193
intellect 13

they 5
are 12
engaged 1

only 1
their 2

very 1
first 8

thus 1
its 2
discovery 2
depends 1
not 85
at 272
all 162

altogether 1
upon 1

You 29
will 39
now 10
understand 8
what 14
I 4330
meant 3
in 2719
suggesting 1
that 11
had 11
the 193
purloined 1
letter 20
been 1
hidden 1
any 17
where 21
within 3
the 193
limits 1
of 109
the 193
Prefect's 1
examination 3
in 2719
other 5
words 5
had 11
the 193
principle 4

been 1
comprehended 1
within 3
the 193

of 109
the 193
Prefect 6
its 2
discovery 2
would 5
have 11
been 1
a 6799
matter 7
altogether 1
beyond 1
question 16
This 6
functionary 2
however 1
has 41
been 1
thoroughly 1
mystified 1
and 51
the 193
remote 8
source 4
of 109
his 43
defeat 13
lies 1
in 2719
the 193
supposition 3
that 11
the 193
Minister 6
is 124
a 6799
fool 21
because 1
he 962
has 41
acquired 1
renown 3
as 509
a 6799
poet 14
All 162
fools 3
are 12
poets 1
this 6
the 193
Prefect 6
feels 1
and 51
he 962
is 124
merely 1
guilty 1
of 109
a 6799

But 82
is 124
this 6
really 1
the 193
poet 14
I 4330
asked 1
There 21
are 12
two 14
brothers 1
I 4330
know 12
and 51
both 8
have 11
attained 1
reputation 3
in 2719
letters 1
The 193
Minister 6
I 4330
believe 6
has 41
written 1
learnedly 1
on 86
the 193
Differential 3
Calculus 2
He 962
is 124
a 6799
mathematician 3
and 51
no 896

You 29
are 12
mistaken 2
I 4330
know 12
him 9
well 24
he 962
is 124
both 8
As 509
poet 14
and 51
mathematician 3
he 962
would 5
reason 13
well 24
as 509
mere 10
mathematician 3
he 962
could 2
not 85
have 11
reasoned 1
at 272
all 162
and 51
thus 1
would 5
have 11
been 1
at 272
the 193

the 193
Prefect 6
You 29

proceed 7

the 193

thus 1
the 193
value 8

in 2719

than 22
the 193

I 4330
dispute 7
in 2719
particular 13
the 193
reason 13
educed 1
by 57
mathematical 2
study 3
The 193
mathematics 2
are 12
the 193
science 3
of 109
form 68
and 51
quantity 2
mathematical 2
reasoning 2
is 124
merely 1
logic 9
applied 1
to 805
observation 4
upon 1
form 68
and 51
quantity 2
The 193
great 12
error 3
lies 1
in 2719
supposing 1
that 11
even 36
the 193
truths 1
of 109
what 14
is 124
called 1
pure 14
algebra 5
are 12
abstract 15
or 333
general 22
truths 1
And 51
this 6
error 3
is 124
so 797
egregious 4
that 11
I 4330
am 392
confounded 1
at 272
the 193
universality 2
with 34
which 2
it 67
has 41
been 1
received 1
Mathematical 2
axioms 1
are 12
not 85
axioms 1
of 109
general 22
truth 7
What 14
is 124
true 9
of 109
relation 7
of 109
form 68
and 51
quantity 2
is 124
often 4
grossly 1
false 12
in 2719
regard 7
to 805
morals 1
for 484
example 4
In 2719
this 6
latter 3
science 3
it 67
is 124
very 1
usually 1
untrue 3
that 11
the 193
aggregated 1
parts 1
are 12
equal 17
to 805
the 193
whole 26
In 2719
chemistry 2
also 3
the 193
axiom 5
fails 1
In 2719
the 193
consideration 3
of 109
motive 4
it 67
fails 1
for 484
two 14
motives 1
each 1
of 109
a 6799
given 3
value 8
have 11
not 85
necessarily 1
a 6799
value 8
when 6
united 2
equal 17
to 805
the 193
sum 70
of 109
their 2
values 1
apart 6
There 21
are 12
numerous 2
other 5
mathematical 2
truths 1
which 2
are 12
only 1
truths 1
within 3
the 193
limits 1
of 109
relation 7
But 82
the 193
mathematician 3
argues 1
from 2
his 43
finite 2
truths 1
through 4
habit 25
as 509
if 8
they 5
were 5
of 109
an 970
absolutely 1
general 22
applicability 2
as 509
the 193
world 12
indeed 1
imagines 1

be 1200
Bryant 1
in 2719
his 43
very 1
learned 2
'Mythology 0
' 0
mentions 1
an 970
analogous 4
source 4
of 109
error 3
when 6
he 962
says 1
that 11
'although 0
the 193
Pagan 6

we 444

With 34
the 193
algebraists 0
however 1
who 79
are 12
Pagans 1
themselves 1
the 193
'Pagan 0

are 12
believed 1

the 193

so 797
much 2
through 4
lapse 4
of 109
memory 2
as 509
through 4
an 970
unaccountable 1
addling 1
of 109
the 193
brains 7
In 2719
short 62
I 4330
never 3
yet 4
encountered 1
the 193
mere 10
mathematician 3
who 79
could 2
be 1200
trusted 1
out 365
of 109
equal 17
roots 1
or 333
one 19
who 79
did 23
not 85
clandestinely 1
hold 22
it 67
as 509
a 6799
point 22
of 109
his 43
faith 13
that 11
x 109
px 1
was 93
absolutely 1

unconditionally 1
equal 17

Say 7
to 805
one 19
of 109
these 4
gentlemen 1
by 57
way 27
of 109
experiment 12
if 8
you 29
please 3
that 11
you 29
believe 6
occasions 1
may 49
occur 7
where 21
x 109
px 1
is 124
not 85
altogether 1
equal 17
to 805

and 51
having 1
made 13
him 9
understand 8
what 14
you 29
mean 36
get 13
out 365
of 109
his 43
reach 6
as 509
speedily 1
as 509
convenient 2
for 484
beyond 1
doubt 15
he 962
will 39
endeavor 5
to 805
knock 21
you 29
down 90
I 4330
mean 36

say 7
continued 1
Dupin 2
while 4
I 4330
merely 1
laughed 1
at 272
his 43
last 7
observations 1
that 11
if 8
the 193
Minister 6
had 11
been 1
no 896
more 11
than 22
a 6799
mathematician 3
the 193
Prefect 6
would 5
have 11
been 1
under 288
no 896
necessity 2
of 109
giving 2
me 1041
this 6
check 40
I 4330
know 12
him 9
however 1
as 509
both 8
mathematician 3
and 51
poet 14
and 51
my 90
measures 1
were 5
adapted 1
to 805
his 43
capacity 2
with 34
reference 4
to 805
the 193
circumstances 1
by 57
which 2
he 962
was 93
surrounded 1
I 4330
knew 1
him 9
as 509
a 6799
courtier 3
too 50
and 51
as 509
a 6799
bold 9
intriguant 0
Such 2
a 6799
man 342
I 4330
considered 1
could 2
not 85
fail 12
to 805
be 1200
aware 3
of 109
the 193
ordinary 2
policial 0
modes 6
of 109
action 4
He 962
could 2
not 85
have 11
failed 1
to 805
anticipate 3
and 51
events 1
have 11
proved 1
that 11
he 962
did 23
not 85
fail 12
to 805
anticipate 3
the 193
waylayings 0
to 805
which 2
he 962
was 93
subjected 1
He 962
must 28
have 11
foreseen 1
I 4330
reflected 1
the 193
secret 25
investigations 1
of 109
his 43
premises 1
His 43
frequent 9
absences 1
from 2
home 90
at 272
night 61
which 2
were 5
hailed 1
by 57
the 193
Prefect 6
as 509
certain 5
aids 3
to 805
his 43
success 13
I 4330
regarded 1
only 1
as 509
ruses 1
to 805
afford 6
opportunity 2
for 484
thorough 13
search 12
to 805
the 193
police 10
and 51
thus 1
the 193
sooner 1
to 805
impress 24
them 9
with 34
the 193
conviction 3
to 805
which 2
G 4017
in 2719
fact 35
did 23
finally 1
arrive 3
the 193
conviction 3
that 11
the 193
letter 20
was 93
not 85
upon 1
the 193
premises 1
I 4330
felt 5
also 3
that 11
the 193
whole 26
train 22

which 2
I 4330
was 93
at 272
some 30
pains 4

for 484
articles 1
concealed 1
I 4330
felt 5
that 11
this 6
whole 26
train 22
of 109
thought 11
would 5
necessarily 1
pass 66
through 4
the 193
mind 25
of 109
the 193
Minister 6
It 67
would 5
imperatively 1
lead 15
him 9
to 805
despise 3
all 162
the 193
ordinary 2
nooks 1
of 109
concealment 2
He 962
could 2
not 85
I 4330
reflected 1
be 1200
so 797
weak 20
as 509
not 85
to 805
see 70
that 11
the 193
most 3
intricate 2
and 51
remote 8
recess 15
of 109
his 43
hotel 6
would 5
be 1200
as 509
open 21
as 509
his 43
commonest 1
closets 1
to 805
the 193
eyes 8
to 805
the 193
probes 1
to 805
the 193
gimlets 1
and 51
to 805
the 193
microscopes 1
of 109
the 193
Prefect 6
I 4330
saw 24
in 2719
fine 17
that 11
he 962
would 5
be 1200
driven 1
as 509
a 6799
matter 7
of 109
course 10
to 805
simplicity 2
if 8
not 85
deliberately 1
induced 1
to 805
it 67
as 509
a 6799
matter 7
of 109
choice 5
You 29
will 39
remember 4
perhaps 1
how 27
desperately 1
the 193
Prefect 6
laughed 1
when 6
I 4330
suggested 1
upon 1
our 3
first 8
interview 11
that 11
it 67
was 93
just 24
possible 3
this 6
mystery 2
troubled 1
him 9
so 797
much 2
on 86
account 14
of 109
its 2
being 3
so 797
very 1
self 11
evident 2
Yes 16
said 1
I 4330
I 4330
remember 4
his 43
merriment 2
well 24
I 4330
really 1
thought 11
he 962
would 5
have 11
fallen 1
into 26
convulsions 1
The 193
material 17
world 12
continued 1
Dupin 2
abounds 1
with 34
very 1
strict 9
analogies 1
to 805
the 193
immaterial 6
and 51
thus 1
some 30
color 46
of 109
truth 7
has 41
been 1
given 3
to 805
the 193
rhetorical 2
dogma 10
that 11
metaphor 6
or 333
simile 3
may 49
be 1200
made 13
to 805
strengthen 7
an 970
argument 9
as 509
well 24
as 509
to 805
embellish 7
a 6799
description 3
The 193
principle 4
of 109
the 193
vis 88
inertiae 0
for 484
example 4
seems 1
to 805
be 1200
identical 2
in 2719
physics 2
and 51
metaphysics 2
It 67
is 124
not 85
more 11
true 9
in 2719
the 193
former 3
that 11
a 6799
large 11
body 15
is 124
with 34
more 11
difficulty 2
set 40
in 2719
motion 9
than 22
a 6799
smaller 1
one 19
and 51
that 11
its 2
subsequent 2
momentum 2
is 124
commensurate 2
with 34
this 6
difficulty 2
than 22
it 67
is 124
in 2719
the 193
latter 3
that 11
intellects 1
of 109
the 193
vaster 1
capacity 2
while 4
more 11
forcible 1
more 11
constant 7
and 51
more 11
eventful 4
in 2719
their 2
movements 1
than 22
those 1
of 109
inferior 5
grade 7
are 12
yet 4
the 193
less 19
readily 1
moved 1
and 51
more 11
embarrassed 1
and 51
full 16
of 109
hesitation 3
in 2719
the 193
first 8
few 6
steps 7
of 109
their 2
progress 14
Again 2
have 11
you 29
ever 33
noticed 1
which 2
of 109
the 193
street 15
signs 1
over 596
the 193
shop 33
doors 9
are 12
the 193
most 3
attractive 4
of 109
attention 3
I 4330
have 11
never 3
given 3
the 193
matter 7
a 6799
thought 11
I 4330
said 1
There 21
is 124
a 6799
game 24
of 109
puzzles 1
he 962
resumed 1
which 2
is 124
played 1
upon 1
a 6799
map 19
One 19
party 3
playing 1
requires 1
another 1
to 805
find 10
a 6799
given 3
word 26
the 193
name 17
of 109
town 27
river 17
state 41
or 333
empire 3
any 17
word 26
in 2719
short 62
upon 1
the 193
motley 3
and 51
perplexed 2
surface 4
of 109
the 193
chart 18
A 6799
novice 3
in 2719
the 193
game 24
generally 1
seeks 1
to 805
embarrass 8
his 43
opponents 1
by 57
giving 2
them 9
the 193
most 3
minutely 1
lettered 1
names 4
but 82
the 193
adept 6
selects 1
such 2
words 5
as 509
stretch 15
in 2719
large 11
characters 1
from 2
one 19
end 92
of 109
the 193
chart 18
to 805
the 193
other 5
These 4
like 22
the 193
over 596
largely 1
lettered 1
signs 1
and 51
placards 1
of 109
the 193
street 15
escape 10
observation 4
by 57
dint 2
of 109
being 3
excessively 1
obvious 4
and 51
here 31
the 193
physical 5
oversight 3
is 124
precisely 1
analogous 4
with 34
the 193
moral 25
inapprehension 0
by 57
which 2
the 193
intellect 13
suffers 1
to 805
pass 66
unnoticed 1
those 1
considerations 1
which 2
are 12
too 50
obtrusively 1
and 51
too 50
palpably 1
self 11
evident 2
But 82
this 6
is 124
a 6799
point 22
it 67
appears 1
somewhat 2
above 3
or 333
beneath 1
the 193
understanding 4
of 109
the 193
Prefect 6
He 962
never 3
once 2
thought 11
it 67
probable 3
or 333
possible 3
that 11
the 193
Minister 6
had 11
deposited 1
the 193
letter 20
immediately 1
beneath 1
the 193
nose 20
of 109
the 193
whole 26
world 12
by 57
way 27
of 109
best 37
preventing 1
any 17
portion 5
of 109
that 11
world 12
from 2
perceiving 1
it 67
But 82
the 193
more 11
I 4330
reflected 1
upon 1
the 193
daring 3
dashing 2
and 51
discriminating 1
ingenuity 2
of 109
D 6926
upon 1
the 193
fact 35
that 11
the 193
document 11
must 28
always 1
have 11
been 1
at 272
hand 137
if 8
he 962
intended 3
to 805
use 18
it 67
to 805
good 28
purpose 12
and 51
upon 1
the 193
decisive 4
evidence 4
obtained 1
by 57
the 193
Prefect 6
that 11
it 67
was 93
not 85
hidden 1
within 3
the 193
limits 1
of 109
that 11
dignitary's 1
ordinary 2
search 12
the 193
more 11
satisfied 1
I 4330
became 1
that 11
to 805
conceal 10
this 6
letter 20
the 193
Minister 6
had 11
resorted 1
to 805
the 193
comprehensive 6
and 51
sagacious 2
expedient 4
of 109
not 85
attempting 1
to 805
conceal 10
it 67
at 272
all 162
Full 16
of 109
these 4
ideas 1
I 4330
prepared 3
myself 1
with 34
a 6799
pair 7
of 109
green 57
spectacles 2
and 51
called 1
one 19
fine 17
morning 3
quite 1
by 57
accident 7
at 272
the 193
Ministerial 1
hotel 6
I 4330
found 18
D 6926
at 272
home 90
yawning 1
lounging 1
and 51
dawdling 1
as 509
usual 3
and 51
pretending 1
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
the 193
last 7
extremity 2
of 109
ennui 2
He 962
is 124
perhaps 1
the 193
most 3
really 1
energetic 2
human 41
being 3
now 10
alive 3
but 82
that 11
is 124
only 1
when 6
nobody 2
sees 6
him 9
To 805
be 1200
even 36
with 34
him 9
I 4330
complained 1
of 109
my 90
weak 20
eyes 8
and 51
lamented 1
the 193
necessity 2
of 109
the 193
spectacles 2
under 288
cover 21
of 109
which 2
I 4330
cautiously 1
and 51
thoroughly 1
surveyed 1
the 193
whole 26
apartment 3
while 4
seemingly 1
intent 11
only 1
upon 1
the 193
conversation 8
of 109
my 90
host 35
I 4330
paid 1
especial 2
attention 3
to 805
a 6799
large 11
writing 3
table 27
near 15
which 2
he 962
sat 92
and 51
upon 1
which 2
lay 42
confusedly 1
some 30
miscellaneous 2
letters 1
and 51
other 5
papers 1
with 34
one 19
or 333
two 14
musical 9
instruments 1
and 51
a 6799
few 6
books 15
Here 31
however 1
after 48
a 6799
long 49
and 51
very 1
deliberate 6
scrutiny 2
I 4330
saw 24
nothing 5
to 805
excite 10
particular 13
suspicion 3
At 272
length 14
my 90
eyes 8
in 2719
going 3
the 193
circuit 14
of 109
the 193
room 22
fell 22
upon 1
a 6799
trumpery 2
fillagree 0
card 54
rack 16
of 109
pasteboard 2
that 11
hung 18
dangling 1
by 57
a 6799
dirty 2
blue 61
ribbon 3
from 2
a 6799
little 6
brass 15
knob 7
just 24
beneath 1
the 193
middle 14
of 109
the 193
mantel 8
piece 10
In 2719
this 6
rack 16
which 2
had 11
three 12
or 333
four 26
compartments 1
were 5
five 5
or 333
six 24
visiting 1
cards 7
and 51
a 6799
solitary 2
letter 20
This 6
last 7
was 93
much 2
soiled 1
and 51
crumpled 1
It 67
was 93
torn 4
nearly 1
in 2719
two 14
across 1
the 193
middle 14
as 509
if 8
a 6799
design 16
in 2719
the 193
first 8
instance 4
to 805
tear 26
it 67
entirely 1
up 194
as 509
worthless 4
had 11
been 1
altered 1
or 333
stayed 1
in 2719
the 193
second 16
It 67
had 11
a 6799
large 11
black 92
seal 13
bearing 3
the 193
D 6926
cipher 5
very 1
conspicuously 1
and 51
was 93
addressed 1
in 2719
a 6799
diminutive 3
female 5
hand 137
to 805
D 6926
the 193
minister 6
himself 1
It 67
was 93
thrust 4
carelessly 1
and 51
even 36
as 509
it 67
seemed 1
contemptuously 1
into 26
one 19
of 109
the 193
uppermost 1
divisions 1
of 109
the 193
rack 16
No 896
sooner 1
had 11
I 4330
glanced 1
at 272
this 6
letter 20
than 22
I 4330
concluded 1
it 67
to 805
be 1200
that 11
of 109
which 2
I 4330
was 93
in 2719
search 12
To 805
be 1200
sure 11
it 67
was 93
to 805
all 162
appearance 3
radically 1
different 11
from 2
the 193
one 19
of 109
which 2
the 193
Prefect 6
had 11
read 49
us 70
so 797
minute 12
a 6799
description 3
Here 31
the 193
seal 13
was 93
large 11
and 51
black 92
with 34
the 193
D 6926
cipher 5
there 21
it 67
was 93
small 14
and 51
red 211
with 34
the 193
ducal 1
arms 3
of 109
the 193
S 13058
family 2
Here 31
the 193
address 9
to 805
the 193
Minister 6
diminutive 3
and 51
feminine 4
there 21
the 193
superscription 2
to 805
a 6799
certain 5
royal 11
personage 3
was 93
markedly 1
bold 9
and 51
decided 2
the 193
size 5
alone 1
formed 1
a 6799
point 22
of 109
correspondence 3
But 82
then 5
the 193
radicalness 0
of 109
these 4
differences 1
which 2
was 93
excessive 2
the 193
dirt 13
the 193
soiled 1
and 51
torn 4
condition 13
of 109
the 193
paper 35
so 797
inconsistent 2
with 34
the 193
true 9
methodical 4
habits 1
of 109
D 6926
and 51
so 797
suggestive 4
of 109
a 6799
design 16
to 805
delude 3
the 193
beholder 3
into 26
an 970
idea 21
of 109
the 193
worthlessness 2
of 109
the 193
document 11
these 4
things 1
together 3
with 34
the 193
hyper 54
obtrusive 4
situation 3
of 109
this 6
document 11
full 16
in 2719
the 193
view 18
of 109
every 10
visiter 0
and 51
thus 1
exactly 1
in 2719
accordance 2
with 34
the 193
conclusions 1
to 805
which 2
I 4330
had 11
previously 1
arrived 1
these 4
things 1
I 4330
say 7
were 5
strongly 1
corroborative 1
of 109
suspicion 3
in 2719
one 19
who 79
came 36
with 34
the 193
intention 5
to 805
suspect 5
I 4330
protracted 1
my 90
visit 14
as 509
long 49
as 509
possible 3
and 51
while 4
I 4330
maintained 1
a 6799
most 3
animated 2
discussion 3
with 34
the 193
Minister 6
upon 1
a 6799
topic 7
which 2
I 4330
knew 1
well 24
had 11
never 3
failed 1
to 805
interest 6
and 51
excite 10
him 9
I 4330
kept 1
my 90
attention 3
really 1
riveted 1
upon 1
the 193
letter 20
In 2719
this 6
examination 3
I 4330
committed 1
to 805
memory 2
its 2
external 11
appearance 3
and 51
arrangement 3
in 2719
the 193
rack 16
and 51
also 3
fell 22
at 272
length 14
upon 1
a 6799
discovery 2
which 2
set 40
at 272
rest 110
whatever 1
trivial 11
doubt 15
I 4330
might 9
have 11
entertained 1
In 2719
scrutinizing 1
the 193
edges 1
of 109
the 193
paper 35
I 4330
observed 1
them 9
to 805
be 1200
more 11
chafed 1
than 22
seemed 1
necessary 2
They 5
presented 1
the 193
broken 6
appearance 3
which 2
is 124
manifested 1
when 6
a 6799
stiff 18
paper 35
having 1
been 1
once 2
folded 1
and 51
pressed 1
with 34
a 6799
folder 3
is 124
refolded 1
in 2719
a 6799
reversed 1
direction 5
in 2719
the 193
same 5
creases 1
or 333
edges 1
which 2
had 11
formed 1
the 193
original 6
fold 12
This 6
discovery 2
was 93
sufficient 2
It 67
was 93
clear 23
to 805
me 1041
that 11
the 193
letter 20
had 11
been 1
turned 1
as 509
a 6799
glove 6
inside 6
out 365
re 3833
directed 1
and 51
re 3833
sealed 1
I 4330
bade 2
the 193
Minister 6
good 28
morning 3
and 51
took 1
my 90
departure 3
at 272
once 2
leaving 3
a 6799
gold 45
snuff 19
box 21
upon 1
the 193
table 27
The 193
next 2
morning 3
I 4330
called 1
for 484
the 193
snuff 19
box 21
when 6
we 444
resumed 1
quite 1
eagerly 1
the 193
conversation 8
of 109
the 193
preceding 1
day 27
While 4
thus 1
engaged 1
however 1
a 6799
loud 16
report 12
as 509
if 8
of 109
a 6799
pistol 3
was 93
heard 1
immediately 1
beneath 1
the 193
windows 4
of 109
the 193
hotel 6
and 51
was 93
succeeded 1
by 57
a 6799
series 2
of 109
fearful 4
screams 1
and 51
the 193
shoutings 0
of 109
a 6799
terrified 1
mob 27
D 6926
rushed 1
to 805
a 6799
casement 3
threw 1
it 67
open 21
and 51
looked 1
out 365
In 2719
the 193
meantime 2
I 4330
stepped 1
to 805
the 193
card 54
rack 16
took 1
the 193
letter 20
put 47
it 67
in 2719
my 90
pocket 14
and 51
replaced 1
it 67
by 57
a 6799
fac 87
simile 3
so 797
far 91
as 509
regards 2
externals 1
which 2
I 4330
had 11
carefully 1
prepared 3
at 272
my 90
lodgings 2
imitating 1
the 193
D 6926

very 1
readily 1

The 193
disturbance 3
in 2719
the 193
street 15
had 11
been 1
occasioned 1
by 57
the 193
frantic 2
behavior 10
of 109
a 6799
man 342
with 34
a 6799
musket 8
He 962
had 11
fired 3
it 67
among 1
a 6799
crowd 5
of 109
women 5
and 51
children 1
It 67
proved 1
however 1
to 805
have 11
been 1
without 1
ball 77
and 51
the 193
fellow 9
was 93
suffered 1
to 805
go 500
his 43
way 27
as 509
a 6799
lunatic 3
or 333
a 6799
drunkard 3
When 6
he 962
had 11
gone 4
D 6926
came 36
from 2
the 193
window 12
whither 1
I 4330
had 11
followed 1
him 9
immediately 1
upon 1
securing 1
the 193
object 26
in 2719
view 18
Soon 3
afterwards 1
I 4330
bade 2
him 9
farewell 3
The 193
pretended 1
lunatic 3
was 93
a 6799
man 342
in 2719
my 90
own 9
pay 52
But 82
what 14
purpose 12
had 11
you 29
I 4330
asked 1
in 2719
replacing 1
the 193
letter 20
by 57
a 6799
fac 87
simile 3
Would 5
it 67
not 85
have 11
been 1
better 7
at 272
the 193
first 8
visit 14
to 805
have 11
seized 1
it 67
openly 1
and 51
departed 2
D 6926
replied 1
Dupin 2
is 124
a 6799
desperate 4
man 342
and 51
a 6799
man 342
of 109
nerve 8
His 43
hotel 6
too 50
is 124
not 85
without 1
attendants 1
devoted 2
to 805
his 43
interests 1
Had 11
I 4330
made 13
the 193
wild 36
attempt 5
you 29
suggest 15
I 4330
might 9
never 3
have 11
left 19
the 193
Ministerial 1
presence 3
alive 3
The 193
good 28
people 4
of 109
Paris 11
might 9
have 11
heard 1
of 109
me 1041
no 896
more 11
But 82
I 4330
had 11
an 970
object 26
apart 6
from 2
these 4
considerations 1
You 29
know 12
my 90
political 2
prepossessions 1
In 2719
this 6
matter 7
I 4330
act 69
as 509
a 6799
partisan 5
of 109
the 193
lady 18
concerned 2
For 484
eighteen 6
months 1
the 193
Minister 6
has 41
had 11
her 181
in 2719
his 43
power 19
She 199
has 41
now 10
him 9
in 2719
hers 9
since 7
being 3
unaware 4
that 11
the 193
letter 20
is 124
not 85
in 2719
his 43
possession 3
he 962
will 39
proceed 7
with 34
his 43
exactions 0
as 509
if 8
it 67
was 93
Thus 1
will 39
he 962
inevitably 1
commit 19
himself 1
at 272
once 2
to 805
his 43
political 2
destruction 2
His 43
downfall 4
too 50
will 39
not 85
be 1200
more 11
precipitate 5
than 22
awkward 6
It 67
is 124
all 162
very 1
well 24
to 805
talk 18
about 1
the 193
facilis 0
descensus 0
Averni 0
but 82
in 2719
all 162
kinds 1
of 109
climbing 2
as 509
Catalani 0
said 1
of 109
singing 2
it 67
is 124
far 91
more 11
easy 2
to 805
get 13
up 194
than 22
to 805
come 36
down 90
In 2719
the 193
present 20
instance 4
I 4330
have 11
no 896
sympathy 2
at 272
least 3
no 896
pity 4
for 484
him 9
who 79
descends 1
He 962
is 124
that 11
monstrum 0
horrendum 0
an 970
unprincipled 1
man 342
of 109
genius 3
I 4330
confess 14
however 1
that 11
I 4330
should 7
like 22
very 1
well 24
to 805
know 12
the 193
precise 8
character 16
of 109
his 43
thoughts 1
when 6
being 3
defied 1
by 57
her 181
whom 3
the 193
Prefect 6
terms 1
'a 0
certain 5
personage' 2
he 962
is 124
reduced 1
to 805
opening 3
the 193

I 4330
left 19
for 484
him 9
in 2719

did 23
not 85
seem 10
altogether 1
right 31

leave 14

once 2

I 4330
told 1
him 9
quite 1
good 28
humoredly 0
that 11
I 4330
should 7
remember 4
So 797
as 509
I 4330
knew 1

would 5
feel 11
some 30
curiosity 2

regard 7
to 805
the 193
identity 2
of 109
the 193

I 4330
thought 11
it 67
a 6799

not 85
to 805
give 15

SAYING 3
HAVING 1
had 11
occasion 7
lately 1
in 2719
the 193
course 10
of 109
some 30
Oriental 5
investigations 1
to 805
consult 14
the 193
Tellmenow 0
Isitsoornot 0
a 6799
work 87
which 2
like 22
the 193
Zohar 0

Simeon 0
Jochaides 0
is 124
scarcely 1
known 1
at 272
all 162
even 36
in 2719
Europe 5

which 2
has 41
never 3
been 1
quoted 1
to 805
my 90
knowledge 4
by 57
any 17
American 15
if 8

perhaps 1
the 193
author 30
of 109
the 193
Curiosities 1

American 15
Literature 2
having 1
had 11
occasion 7
I 4330
say 7
to 805
turn 46
over 596
some 30
pages 1
of 109
the 193
first 8
mentioned 1
very 1
remarkable 3
work 87
I 4330
was 93
not 85
a 6799
little 6
astonished 1
to 805
discover 10
that 11
the 193
literary 1
world 12
has 41
hitherto 1
been 1
strangely 1
in 2719
error 3
respecting 1
the 193
fate 8
of 109
the 193
vizier's 1
daughter 4
Scheherazade 2
as 509
that 11
fate 8
is 124
depicted 1
in 2719
the 193
Arabian 3
Nights 16
and 51
that 11
the 193
denouement 3
there 21
given 3
if 8
not 85
altogether 1
inaccurate 2
as 509
far 91
as 509
it 67
goes 1
is 124
at 272
least 3
to 805
blame 12
in 2719
not 85
having 1
gone 4
very 1
much 2
farther 2
For 484
full 16
information 3
on 86
this 6
interesting 2
topic 7
I 4330
must 28
refer 28
the 193
inquisitive 4
reader 6
to 805
the 193
Isitsoornot 0
itself 1
but 82
in 2719
the 193
meantime 2
I 4330
shall 12
be 1200
pardoned 1
for 484
giving 2
a 6799
summary 2
of 109
what 14
I 4330
there 21
discovered 1
It 67
will 39
be 1200
remembered 1
that 11
in 2719
the 193
usual 3
version 3
of 109
the 193
tales 1
a 6799
certain 5
monarch 14
having 1
good 28
cause 14
to 805
be 1200
jealous 5
of 109
his 43
queen 11
not 85
only 1
puts 4
her 181
to 805
death 19
but 82
makes 4
a 6799
vow 8
by 57
his 43
beard 9
and 51
the 193
prophet 9
to 805
espouse 3
each 1
night 61
the 193
most 3
beautiful 2
maiden 13
in 2719
his 43
dominions 1
and 51
the 193
next 2
morning 3
to 805
deliver 16
her 181
up 194
to 805
the 193
executioner 3
Having 1
fulfilled 1
this 6
vow 8
for 484
many 2
years 1
to 805
the 193
letter 20
and 51
with 34
a 6799
religious 5
punctuality 2
and 51
method 18
that 11
conferred 1
great 12
credit 12
upon 1
him 9
as 509
a 6799
man 342
of 109
devout 6
feeling 4
and 51
excellent 2
sense 8
he 962
was 93
interrupted 1
one 19
afternoon 3
no 896
doubt 15
at 272
his 43
prayers 1
by 57
a 6799
visit 14
from 2
his 43
grand 74
vizier 3
to 805
whose 1
daughter 4
it 67
appears 1
there 21
had 11
occurred 1
an 970
idea 21
Her 181
name 17
was 93
Scheherazade 2
and 51
her 181
idea 21
was 93
that 11
she 199
would 5
either 1
redeem 8
the 193
land 77
from 2
the 193
depopulating 1
tax 42
upon 1
its 2
beauty 2
or 333
perish 9
after 48
the 193
approved 1
fashion 10
of 109
all 162
heroines 1
in 2719
the 193
attempt 5
Accordingly 1
and 51
although 1
we 444
do 814
not 85
find 10
it 67
to 805
be 1200
leap 13
year 19
which 2
makes 4
the 193
sacrifice 4
more 11
meritorious 4
she 199
deputes 1
her 181
father 12
the 193
grand 74
vizier 3
to 805
make 17
an 970
offer 10
to 805
the 193
king 23
of 109
her 181
hand 137
This 6
hand 137
the 193
king 23
eagerly 1
accepts 1
he 962
had 11
intended 3
to 805
take 18
it 67
at 272
all 162
events 1
and 51
had 11
put 47
off 100
the 193
matter 7
from 2
day 27
to 805
day 27
only 1
through 4
fear 14
of 109
the 193
vizier 3
but 82
in 2719
accepting 1
it 67
now 10
he 962
gives 1
all 162
parties 1
very 1
distinctly 1
to 805
understand 8
that 11
grand 74
vizier 3
or 333
no 896
grand 74
vizier 3
he 962
has 41
not 85
the 193
slightest 1
design 16
of 109
giving 2
up 194
one 19
iota 3
of 109
his 43
vow 8
or 333
of 109
his 43
privileges 1
When 6
therefore 1
the 193
fair 25
Scheherazade 2
insisted 1
upon 1
marrying 1
the 193
king 23
and 51
did 23
actually 1
marry 2
him 9
despite 1
her 181
father's 1
excellent 2
advice 2
not 85
to 805
do 814
any 17
thing 15
of 109
the 193
kind 31
when 6
she 199
would 5
and 51
did 23
marry 2
him 9
I 4330
say 7
will 39
I 4330
nill 0
I 4330
it 67
was 93
with 34
her 181
beautiful 2
black 92
eyes 8
as 509
thoroughly 1
open 21
as 509
the 193
nature 3
of 109
the 193
case 25
would 5
allow 9
It 67
seems 1
however 1
that 11
this 6
politic 19
damsel 6
who 79
had 11
been 1
reading 3
Machiavelli 3
beyond 1
doubt 15
had 11
a 6799
very 1
ingenious 4
little 6
plot 8
in 2719
her 181
mind 25
On 86
the 193
night 61
of 109
the 193
wedding 3
she 199
contrived 1
upon 1
I 4330
forget 8
what 14
specious 4
pretence 0
to 805
have 11
her 181
sister 9
occupy 2
a 6799
couch 7
sufficiently 1
near 15
that 11
of 109
the 193
royal 11
pair 7
to 805
admit 7
of 109
easy 2
conversation 8
from 2
bed 93
to 805
bed 93
and 51
a 6799
little 6
before 2
cock 60
crowing 1
she 199
took 1
care 47
to 805
awaken 6
the 193
good 28
monarch 14
her 181
husband 10
who 79
bore 13
her 181
none 32
the 193
worse 6
will 39
because 1
he 962
intended 3
to 805
wring 7
her 181
neck 23
on 86
the 193
morrow 3
she 199
managed 1
to 805
awaken 6
him 9
I 4330
say 7
although 1
on 86
account 14
of 109
a 6799
capital 17
conscience 4
and 51
an 970
easy 2
digestion 3
he 962
slept 1
well 24
by 57
the 193
profound 6
interest 6
of 109
a 6799
story 13
about 1
a 6799
rat 114
and 51
a 6799
black 92
cat 237
I 4330
think 8
which 2
she 199
was 93
narrating 1
all 162
in 2719
an 970
undertone 3
of 109
course 10
to 805
her 181
sister 9
When 6
the 193
day 27
broke 15
it 67
so 797
happened 1
that 11
this 6
history 2
was 93
not 85
altogether 1
finished 1
and 51
that 11
Scheherazade 2
in 2719
the 193
nature 3
of 109
things 1
could 2
not 85
finish 8
it 67
just 24
then 5
since 7
it 67
was 93
high 54
time 45
for 484
her 181
to 805
get 13
up 194
and 51
be 1200
bowstrung 0
a 6799
thing 15
very 1
little 6
more 11
pleasant 9
than 22
hanging 3
only 1
a 6799
trifle 7
more 11
genteel 4
The 193
king's 1
curiosity 2
however 1
prevailing 1
I 4330
am 392
sorry 1
to 805
say 7
even 36
over 596
his 43
sound 29
religious 5
principles 1
induced 1
him 9
for 484
this 6
once 2
to 805
postpone 6
the 193
fulfilment 0
of 109
his 43
vow 8
until 1
next 2
morning 3
for 484
the 193
purpose 12
and 51
with 34
the 193
hope 16
of 109
hearing 3
that 11
night 61
how 27
it 67
fared 1
in 2719
the 193
end 92
with 34
the 193
black 92
cat 237
a 6799
black 92
cat 237
I 4330
think 8
it 67
was 93
and 51
the 193
rat 114
The 193
night 61
having 1
arrived 1
however 1
the 193
lady 18
Scheherazade 2
not 85
only 1
put 47
the 193
finishing 1
stroke 4
to 805
the 193
black 92
cat 237
and 51
the 193
rat 114
the 193
rat 114
was 93
blue 61
but 82
before 2
she 199
well 24
knew 1
what 14
she 199
was 93
about 1
found 18
herself 1
deep 12
in 2719
the 193
intricacies 1
of 109
a 6799
narration 3
having 1
reference 4
if 8
I 4330
am 392
not 85
altogether 1
mistaken 2
to 805
a 6799
pink 19
horse 52
with 34
green 57
wings 7
that 11
went 1
in 2719
a 6799
violent 2
manner 8
by 57
clockwork 3
and 51
was 93
wound 6
up 194
with 34
an 970
indigo 2
key 50
With 34
this 6
history 2
the 193
king 23
was 93
even 36
more 11
profoundly 1
interested 1
than 22
with 34
the 193
other 5
and 51
as 509
the 193
day 27
broke 15
before 2
its 2
conclusion 3
notwithstanding 1
all 162
the 193
queen's 1
endeavors 1
to 805
get 13
through 4
with 34
it 67
in 2719
time 45
for 484
the 193
bowstringing 0
there 21
was 93
again 2
no 896
resource 8
but 82
to 805
postpone 6
that 11
ceremony 2
as 509
before 2
for 484
twenty 2
four 26
hours 1
The 193
next 2
night 61
there 21
happened 1
a 6799
similar 5
accident 7
with 34
a 6799
similar 5
result 8
and 51
then 5
the 193
next 2
and 51
then 5
again 2
the 193
next 2
so 797
that 11
in 2719
the 193
end 92
the 193
good 28
monarch 14
having 1
been 1
unavoidably 1
deprived 1
of 109
all 162
opportunity 2
to 805
keep 11
his 43
vow 8
during 1
a 6799
period 16
of 109
no 896
less 19
than 22
one 19
thousand 7
and 51
one 19
nights 16
either 1
forgets 1
it 67
altogether 1
by 57
the 193
expiration 2
of 109
this 6
time 45
or 333
gets 1
himself 1
absolved 1
of 109
it 67
in 2719
the 193
regular 13
way 27
or 333
what 14
is 124
more 11
probable 3
breaks 3
it 67
outright 1
as 509
well 24
as 509
the 193
head 140
of 109
his 43
father 12
confessor 3
At 272
all 162
events 1
Scheherazade 2
who 79
being 3
lineally 1
descended 1
from 2
Eve 73
fell 22
heir 9
perhaps 1
to 805
the 193
whole 26
seven 18
baskets 1
of 109
talk 18
which 2
the 193
latter 3
lady 18
we 444
all 162
know 12
picked 1
up 194
from 2
under 288
the 193
trees 1
in 2719
the 193
garden 12
of 109
Eden 3
Scheherazade 2
I 4330
say 7
finally 1
triumphed 1
and 51
the 193
tariff 3
upon 1
beauty 2
was 93
repealed 1
Now 10
this 6
conclusion 3
which 2
is 124
that 11
of 109
the 193
story 13
as 509
we 444
have 11
it 67
upon 1
record 10
is 124
no 896
doubt 15
excessively 1
proper 9
and 51
pleasant 9
but 82
alas 6
like 22
a 6799
great 12
many 2
pleasant 9
things 1
is 124
more 11
pleasant 9
than 22
true 9
and 51
I 4330
am 392
indebted 3
altogether 1
to 805
the 193
Isitsoornot 0
for 484
the 193
means 1
of 109
correcting 1
the 193
error 3
Le 753
mieux 0
says 1
a 6799
French 9
proverb 5
est 68
l'ennemi 0
du 375
bien 8
and 51
in 2719
mentioning 1
that 11
Scheherazade 2
had 11
inherited 1
the 193
seven 18
baskets 1
of 109
talk 18
I 4330
should 7
have 11
added 1
that 11
she 199
put 47
them 9
out 365
at 272
compound 6
interest 6
until 1
they 5
amounted 1
to 805
seventy 2
seven 18
My 90
dear 15
sister 9
said 1
she 199
on 86
the 193
thousand 7
and 51
second 16
night 61
I 4330
quote 4
the 193
language 3
of 109
the 193
Isitsoornot 0
at 272
this 6
point 22
verbatim 1
my 90
dear 15
sister 9
said 1
she 199
now 10
that 11
all 162
this 6
little 6
difficulty 2
about 1
the 193
bowstring 3
has 41
blown 1
over 596
and 51
that 11
this 6
odious 4
tax 42
is 124
so 797
happily 1
repealed 1
I 4330
feel 11
that 11
I 4330
have 11
been 1
guilty 1
of 109
great 12
indiscretion 3
in 2719
withholding 2
from 2
you 29
and 51
the 193
king 23
who 79
I 4330
am 392
sorry 1
to 805
say 7
snores 1
a 6799
thing 15
no 896
gentleman 3
would 5
do 814
the 193
full 16
conclusion 3
of 109
Sinbad 0
the 193
sailor 3
This 6
person 33
went 1
through 4
numerous 2
other 5
and 51
more 11
interesting 2
adventures 5
than 22
those 1
which 2
I 4330
related 3
but 82
the 193
truth 7
is 124
I 4330
felt 5
sleepy 4
on 86
the 193
particular 13
night 61
of 109
their 2
narration 3
and 51
so 797
was 93
seduced 1
into 26
cutting 4
them 9
short 62
a 6799
grievous 4
piece 10
of 109
misconduct 5
for 484
which 2
I 4330
only 1
trust 26
that 11
Allah 3
will 39
forgive 8
me 1041
But 82
even 36
yet 4
it 67
is 124
not 85
too 50
late 23
to 805
remedy 3
my 90
great 12
neglect 9
and 51
as 509
soon 3
as 509
I 4330
have 11
given 3
the 193
king 23
a 6799
pinch 5
or 333
two 14
in 2719
order 11
to 805
wake 12
him 9
up 194
so 797
far 91
that 11
he 962
may 49
stop 36
making 4
that 11
horrible 3
noise 11
I 4330
will 39
forthwith 1
entertain 12
you 29
and 51
him 9
if 8
he 962
pleases 1
with 34
the 193
sequel 3
of 109
this 6
very 1
remarkable 3
story 13
Hereupon 1
the 193
sister 9
of 109
Scheherazade 2
as 509
I 4330
have 11
it 67
from 2
the 193
Isitsoornot 0
expressed 1
no 896
very 1
particular 13
intensity 2
of 109
gratification 3
but 82
the 193
king 23
having 1
been 1
sufficiently 1
pinched 1
at 272
length 14
ceased 1
snoring 1
and 51
finally 1
said 1
hum 148
and 51
then 5
hoo 88
when 6
the 193
queen 11
understanding 4
these 4
words 5
which 2
are 12
no 896
doubt 15
Arabic 2
to 805
signify 2
that 11
he 962
was 93
all 162
attention 3
and 51
would 5
do 814
his 43
best 37
not 85
to 805
snore 7
any 17
more 11
the 193
queen 11
I 4330
say 7
having 1
arranged 1
these 4
matters 1
to 805
her 181
satisfaction 3
re 3833
entered 1
thus 1
at 272
once 2
into 26
the 193
history 2
of 109
Sinbad 0
the 193
sailor 3
'At 0
length 14
in 2719
my 90
old 21
age 24
' 0
these 4
are 12
the 193
words 5
of 109
Sinbad 0
himself 1
as 509
retailed 1
by 57
Scheherazade 2
'at 0
length 14
in 2719
my 90
old 21
age 24
and 51
after 48
enjoying 1
many 2
years 1
of 109
tranquillity 0
at 272
home 90
I 4330
became 1
once 2
more 11
possessed 1
of 109
a 6799
desire 6
of 109
visiting 1
foreign 6
countries 1
and 51
one 19
day 27
without 1
acquainting 1
any 17
of 109
my 90
family 2
with 34
my 90
design 16
I 4330
packed 1
up 194
some 30
bundles 1
of 109
such 2
merchandise 7
as 509
was 93
most 3
precious 4
and 51
least 3
bulky 1
and 51
engaged 1
a 6799
porter 6
to 805
carry 12
them 9
went 1
with 34
him 9
down 90
to 805
the 193
sea 158
shore 10
to 805
await 4
the 193
arrival 3
of 109
any 17
chance 20
vessel 3
that 11
might 9
convey 12
me 1041
out 365
of 109
the 193
kingdom 3
into 26
some 30
region 8
which 2
I 4330
had 11
not 85
as 509
yet 4
explored 1
'Having 0
deposited 1
the 193
packages 1
upon 1
the 193
sands 6
we 444
sat 92
down 90
beneath 1
some 30
trees 1
and 51
looked 1
out 365
into 26
the 193
ocean 22
in 2719
the 193
hope 16
of 109
perceiving 1
a 6799
ship 41
but 82
during 1
several 3
hours 1
we 444
saw 24
none 32
whatever 1
At 272
length 14
I 4330
fancied 1
that 11
I 4330
could 2
hear 76
a 6799
singular 7
buzzing 1
or 333
humming 4
sound 29
and 51
the 193
porter 6
after 48
listening 1
awhile 1
declared 1
that 11
he 962
also 3
could 2
distinguish 5
it 67
Presently 1
it 67
grew 1
louder 1
and 51
then 5
still 13
louder 1
so 797
that 11
we 444
could 2
have 11
no 896
doubt 15
that 11
the 193
object 26
which 2
caused 1
it 67
was 93
approaching 1
us 70
At 272
length 14
on 86
the 193
edge 8
of 109
the 193
horizon 7
we 444
discovered 1
a 6799
black 92
speck 10
which 2
rapidly 1
increased 1
in 2719
size 5
until 1
we 444
made 13
it 67
out 365
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
vast 8
monster 3
swimming 3
with 34
a 6799
great 12
part 102
of 109
its 2
body 15
above 3
the 193
surface 4
of 109
the 193
sea 158
It 67
came 36
toward 2
us 70
with 34
inconceivable 1
swiftness 2
throwing 1
up 194
huge 6
waves 1
of 109
foam 10
around 1
its 2
breast 21
and 51
illuminating 2
all 162
that 11
part 102
of 109
the 193
sea 158
through 4
which 2
it 67
passed 1
with 34
a 6799
long 49
line 36
of 109
fire 103
that 11
extended 1
far 91
off 100
into 26
the 193
distance 4
'As 0
the 193
thing 15
drew 2
near 15

saw 24

distinctly 1

of 109
three 12
of 109
the 193
loftiest 1
trees 1
that 11
grow 21

it 67

as 509

as 509

hall 45

body 15

was 93
unlike 10
that 11
of 109

as 509
solid 21

a 6799
rock 36

of 109
a 6799
jetty 2
blackness 2
throughout 1
all 162
that 11
portion 5
of 109
it 67

floated 1
above 3
the 193
water 88
with 34
the 193
exception 6

a 6799
narrow 10

begirdled 0

we 444
could 2
get 13
only 1
a 6799
glimpse 4
now 10
and 51
then 5
as 509
the 193
monster 3
rose 37
and 51
fell 22
with 34
the 193
billows 1
was 93
entirely 1
covered 1
with 34
metallic 3
scales 1
of 109
a 6799
color 46
like 22
that 11
of 109
the 193
moon 40
in 2719
misty 5
weather 33

back 182
was 93
flat 66

nearly 1
white 55

from 2
it 67
there 21
extended 1
upwards 1

six 24

whole 26

parallel 11

seemed 1

answer 8
the 193
purpose 12

an 970
eyebrow 3

three 12
of 109
these 4
dreadful 4
eyes 8
were 5
much 2
larger 1
than 22
the 193

had 11
the 193
appearance 3

solid 21

served 1

the 193

puffed 1
out 365

surpassed 1
by 57
our 3
astonishment 2

upon 1
getting 1
a 6799
nearer 1

we 444
perceived 1
upon 1
the 193
creature's 1
back 182
a 6799
vast 8
number 8
of 109
animals 1
about 1
the 193
size 5
and 51
shape 13
of 109
men 140

altogether 1
much 2
resembling 1
them 9

that 11
they 5
wore 1
no 896

as 509

supplied 1
by 57
nature 3
no 896

an 970
ugly 1

covering 3
a 6799
good 28
deal 13

fitting 4
so 797
tight 22
to 805

to 805
render 7
the 193
poor 11
wretches 1
laughably 1
awkward 6

put 47
them 9
apparently 1
to 805
severe 7
pain 42

the 193
very 1
tips 10

their 2

were 5
certain 5

at 272

sight 17

thought 11

soon 3
discovered 1

excessively 1
heavy 7

solid 21

therefore 1
concluded 1

great 12

fastened 1
black 92

as 509
we 444
keep 11
on 86
our 3
dogs 5
only 1
much 2
wider 1
and 51
infinitely 1
stiffer 1
so 797
that 11
it 67
was 93
quite 1
impossible 2
for 484
these 4
poor 11
victims 1
to 805
move 10
their 2
heads 25
in 2719
any 17
direction 5
without 1
moving 2
the 193
body 15
at 272
the 193
same 5
time 45

thus 1
they 5
were 5
doomed 1
to 805
perpetual 4
contemplation 2
of 109
their 2
noses 1
a 6799
view 18
puggish 0
and 51
snubby 0
in 2719
a 6799
wonderful 4
if 8
not 85
positively 1
in 2719
an 970
awful 6
degree 3
'When 0
the 193
monster 3
had 11
nearly 1
reached 1
the 193
shore 10
where 21
we 444
stood 1
it 67
suddenly 1
pushed 1
out 365
one 19
of 109
its 2
eyes 8
to 805
a 6799
great 12
extent 3
and 51
emitted 1
from 2
it 67
a 6799
terrible 3
flash 34
of 109
fire 103
accompanied 1
by 57
a 6799
dense 6
cloud 14
of 109
smoke 19
and 51
a 6799
noise 11
that 11
I 4330
can 287
compare 4
to 805
nothing 5
but 82
thunder 32
As 509
the 193
smoke 19
cleared 1
away 1
we 444
saw 24
one 19
of 109
the 193
odd 17
man 342

standing 3
near 15
the 193
head 140
of 109
the 193
large 11
beast 9
with 34
a 6799
trumpet 8
in 2719
his 43
hand 137
through 4
which 2
putting 1
it 67
to 805
his 43
mouth 22
he 962
presently 1
addressed 1
us 70
in 2719
loud 16
harsh 6
and 51
disagreeable 3
accents 1
that 11
perhaps 1
we 444
should 7
have 11
mistaken 2
for 484
language 3
had 11
they 5
not 85
come 36
altogether 1
through 4
the 193
nose 20
'Being 0
thus 1
evidently 1
spoken 1
to 805
I 4330
was 93
at 272
a 6799
loss 3
how 27
to 805
reply 3
as 509
I 4330
could 2
in 2719
no 896
manner 8
understand 8
what 14
was 93
said 1
and 51
in 2719
this 6
difficulty 2
I 4330
turned 1
to 805
the 193
porter 6
who 79
was 93
near 15
swooning 1
through 4
affright 0
and 51
demanded 1
of 109
him 9
his 43
opinion 4
as 509
to 805
what 14
species 2
of 109
monster 3
it 67
was 93
what 14
it 67
wanted 1
and 51
what 14
kind 31
of 109
creatures 1
those 1
were 5
that 11
so 797
swarmed 1
upon 1
its 2
back 182
To 805
this 6
the 193
porter 6
replied 1
as 509
well 24
as 509
he 962
could 2
for 484
trepidation 2
that 11
he 962
had 11
once 2
before 2
heard 1
of 109
this 6
sea 158
beast 9
that 11
it 67
was 93
a 6799
cruel 9
demon 40
with 34
bowels 1
of 109
sulphur 0
and 51
blood 55
of 109
fire 103
created 1
by 57
evil 15
genii 1
as 509
the 193
means 1
of 109
inflicting 1
misery 2
upon 1
mankind 2
that 11
the 193
things 1
upon 1
its 2
back 182
were 5
vermin 3
such 2
as 509
sometimes 1
infest 7
cats 7
and 51
dogs 5
only 1
a 6799
little 6
larger 1
and 51
more 11
savage 12
and 51
that 11
these 4
vermin 3
had 11
their 2
uses 1
however 1
evil 15
for 484
through 4
the 193
torture 7
they 5
caused 1
the 193
beast 9
by 57
their 2
nibbling 1
and 51
stingings 0
it 67
was 93
goaded 1
into 26
that 11
degree 3
of 109
wrath 4
which 2
was 93
requisite 3
to 805
make 17
it 67
roar 9
and 51
commit 19
ill 84
and 51
so 797
fulfil 7
the 193
vengeful 2
and 51
malicious 4
designs 1
of 109
the 193
wicked 6
genii 1
This 6
account 14
determined 2
me 1041
to 805
take 18
to 805
my 90
heels 1
and 51
without 1
once 2
even 36
looking 1
behind 4
me 1041
I 4330
ran 110
at 272
full 16
speed 31
up 194
into 26
the 193
hills 4
while 4
the 193
porter 6
ran 110
equally 1
fast 29
although 1
nearly 1
in 2719
an 970
opposite 4
direction 5
so 797
that 11
by 57
these 4
means 1
he 962
finally 1
made 13
his 43
escape 10
with 34
my 90
bundles 1
of 109
which 2
I 4330
have 11
no 896
doubt 15
he 962
took 1
excellent 2
care 47
although 1
this 6
is 124
a 6799
point 22
I 4330
cannot 1
determine 7
as 509
I 4330
do 814
not 85
remember 4
that 11
I 4330
ever 33
beheld 1
him 9
again 2
'For 0
myself 1
I 4330
was 93
so 797
hotly 1
pursued 1
by 57
a 6799
swarm 5
of 109
the 193
men 140
vermin 3
who 79
had 11
come 36
to 805
the 193

I 4330
was 93
very 1
soon 3
overtaken 1
bound 16

and 51
foot 79

conveyed 1
to 805
the 193
beast 9

immediately 1
swam 16
out 365
again 2
into 26
the 193
middle 14
of 109
the 193
sea 158
'I 0
now 10
bitterly 1
repented 1
my 90
folly 2

a 6799
comfortable 3

my 90

made 13
the 193
best 37
of 109
my 90
condition 13

exerted 1
myself 1
to 805
secure 6
the 193
goodwill 2
of 109
the 193
man 342

that 11
owned 1
the 193

appeared 1
to 805
exercise 7

over 596

succeeded 1
so 797
well 24
in 2719
this 6
endeavor 5
that 11
in 2719
a 6799
few 6
days 1
the 193
creature 3
bestowed 1
upon 1
me 1041
various 2
tokens 1
of 109
his 43
favor 12

in 2719
the 193
end 92
even 36
went 1
to 805
the 193
trouble 18
of 109
teaching 3
me 1041
the 193
rudiments 1
of 109
what 14
it 67
was 93
vain 8
enough 2
to 805
denominate 3
its 2
language 3

that 11
at 272

I 4330
was 93
enabled 1
to 805
converse 5
with 34

so 797
the 193

formed 1

the 193
more 11
forcibly 1
illustrated 1
by 57
the 193
surf 24
which 2
reared 1
high 54
up 194
against 1
its 2
white 55

ghastly 1
crest 7
howling 1

shrieking 1
forever 3
Just 24
opposite 4
the 193
promontory 2
upon 1
whose 1
apex 3
we 444
were 5
placed 1
and 51
at 272
a 6799
distance 4
of 109
some 30
five 5
or 333
six 24
miles 4
out 365
at 272
sea 158
there 21
was 93
visible 1
a 6799
small 14
bleak 6
looking 1
island 6
or 333
more 11
properly 1
its 2
position 6
was 93
discernible 1
through 4
the 193
wilderness 3
of 109
surge 10
in 2719
which 2
it 67
was 93
enveloped 1
About 1
two 14
miles 4
nearer 1
the 193
land 77
arose 1
another 1
of 109
smaller 1
size 5
hideously 1
craggy 1
and 51
barren 7
and 51
encompassed 1
at 272
various 2
intervals 1
by 57
a 6799
cluster 5
of 109
dark 19
rocks 1
The 193
appearance 3
of 109
the 193
ocean 22
in 2719
the 193
space 34
between 1
the 193
more 11
distant 2
island 6
and 51
the 193
shore 10
had 11
something 3
very 1
unusual 2
about 1
it 67
Although 1
at 272
the 193
time 45
so 797
strong 16
a 6799
gale 6
was 93
blowing 1
landward 2
that 11
a 6799
brig 42
in 2719
the 193
remote 8
offing 3
lay 42
to 805
under 288
a 6799
double 14
reefed 1
trysail 0
and 51
constantly 1
plunged 1
her 181
whole 26
hull 11
out 365
of 109
sight 17
still 13
there 21
was 93
here 31
nothing 5
like 22
a 6799
regular 13
swell 13
but 82
only 1
a 6799
short 62
quick 25
angry 1
cross 74
dashing 2
of 109
water 88
in 2719
every 10
direction 5
as 509
well 24
in 2719
the 193
teeth 6
of 109
the 193
wind 101
as 509
otherwise 1
Of 109
foam 10
there 21
was 93
little 6
except 10
in 2719
the 193
immediate 4
vicinity 2
of 109

The 193

These 4
are 12
the 193
true 9
names 4
of 109
the 193
places 1
but 82
why 4
it 67
has 41
been 1
thought 11
necessary 2
to 805
name 17
them 9
at 272
all 162
is 124
more 11
than 22
either 1
you 29
or 333
I 4330
can 287
understand 8
Do 814
you 29
hear 76
anything 3
Do 814
you 29
see 70
any 17
change 21
in 2719
the 193
water 88
We 444
had 11
now 10
been 1
about 1
ten 151
minutes 2
upon 1
the 193
top 71
of 109
Helseggen 0
to 805
which 2
we 444
had 11
ascended 1
from 2
the 193
interior 3
of 109
Lofoden 0
so 797
that 11
we 444
had 11
caught 1
no 896
glimpse 4
of 109
the 193
sea 158
until 1
it 67
had 11
burst 4
upon 1
us 70
from 2
the 193
summit 5
As 509
the 193
old 21
man 342
spoke 14
I 4330
became 1
aware 3
of 109
a 6799
loud 16
and 51
gradually 1
increasing 2
sound 29
like 22
the 193
moaning 1
of 109
a 6799
vast 8
herd 11
of 109
buffaloes 1
upon 1
an 970
American 15
prairie 3
and 51
at 272
the 193
same 5
moment 14
I 4330
perceived 1
that 11
what 14
seamen 1
term 34
the 193
chopping 1
character 16
of 109
the 193
ocean 22
beneath 1
us 70
was 93
rapidly 1
changing 1
into 26
a 6799
current 4
which 2
set 40
to 805
the 193
eastward 2
Even 36
while 4
I 4330
gazed 1
this 6
current 4
acquired 1
a 6799
monstrous 2
velocity 2
Each 1
moment 14
added 1
to 805
its 2
speed 31
to 805
its 2
headlong 1
impetuosity 2
In 2719
five 5
minutes 2
the 193
whole 26
sea 158
as 509
far 91
as 509
Vurrgh 0
was 93
lashed 1
into 26
ungovernable 1
fury 2
but 82
it 67
was 93
between 1
Moskoe 0
and 51
the 193
coast 14
that 11
the 193
main 50
uproar 5
held 1
its 2
sway 8
Here 31
the 193
vast 8
bed 93
of 109
the 193
waters 11
seamed 1
and 51
scarred 1
into 26
a 6799
thousand 7
conflicting 1
channels 1
burst 4
suddenly 1
into 26
phrensied 0
convulsion 3
heaving 1
boiling 2
hissing 1
gyrating 1
in 2719
gigantic 2
and 51
innumerable 1
vortices 0
and 51
all 162
whirling 1
and 51
plunging 1
on 86
to 805
the 193
eastward 2
with 34
a 6799
rapidity 2
which 2
water 88
never 3
elsewhere 1
assumes 1
except 10
in 2719
precipitous 2
descents 1
In 2719
a 6799
few 6
minutes 2
more 11
there 21
came 36
over 596
the 193
scene 5
another 1
radical 12
alteration 3
The 193
general 22
surface 4
grew 1
somewhat 2
more 11
smooth 12
and 51
the 193
whirlpools 1
one 19
by 57
one 19
disappeared 1
while 4
prodigious 2
streaks 1
of 109
foam 10
became 1
apparent 2
where 21
none 32
had 11
been 1
seen 1
before 2
These 4
streaks 1
at 272
length 14
spreading 1
out 365
to 805
a 6799
great 12
distance 4
and 51
entering 1
into 26
combination 3
took 1
unto 7
themselves 1
the 193
gyratory 0
motion 9
of 109
the 193
subsided 1
vortices 0
and 51
seemed 1
to 805
form 68
the 193
germ 25
of 109
another 1
more 11
vast 8
Suddenly 1
very 1
suddenly 1
this 6
assumed 1
a 6799
distinct 13
and 51
definite 4
existence 3
in 2719
a 6799
circle 7
of 109
more 11
than 22
a 6799
mile 15
in 2719
diameter 3
The 193
edge 8
of 109
the 193
whirl 17
was 93
represented 1
by 57
a 6799
broad 41
belt 9
of 109
gleaming 2
spray 8
but 82
no 896
particle 5
of 109
this 6
slipped 1
into 26
the 193
mouth 22
of 109
the 193
terrific 2
funnel 5
whose 1
interior 3
as 509
far 91
as 509
the 193
eye 57
could 2
fathom 7
it 67
was 93
a 6799
smooth 12
shining 1
and 51
jet 22
black 92
wall 46
of 109
water 88
inclined 1
to 805
the 193
horizon 7
at 272
an 970
angle 10
of 109
some 30
forty 2
five 5
degrees 1
speeding 2
dizzily 1
round 29
and 51
round 29
with 34
a 6799
swaying 1
and 51
sweltering 1
motion 9
and 51
sending 1
forth 8
to 805
the 193
winds 25
an 970
appalling 2
voice 8
half 23
shriek 5
half 23
roar 9
such 2
as 509
not 85
even 36
the 193
mighty 1
cataract 3
of 109
Niagara 2
ever 33
lifts 1
up 194
in 2719
its 2
agony 2
to 805
Heaven 9
The 193
mountain 16
trembled 1
to 805
its 2
very 1
base 27
and 51
the 193
rock 36
rocked 1
I 4330
threw 1
myself 1
upon 1
my 90
face 19
and 51
clung 1
to 805
the 193
scant 16
herbage 2
in 2719
an 970
excess 5
of 109
nervous 4
agitation 3
This 6
said 1
I 4330
at 272
length 14
to 805
the 193
old 21
man 342
this 6
can 287
be 1200
nothing 5
else 2
than 22
the 193
great 12
whirlpool 3
of 109
the 193
Maelstr 4
m 6769
So 797
it 67
is 124
sometimes 1
termed 1
said 1

We 444
Norwegians 1
call 57
it 67
the 193
Moskoe 0
str 437
m 6769
from 2
the 193
island 6
of 109
Moskoe 0
in 2719
the 193

The 193
ordinary 2
accounts 1
of 109
this 6
vortex 3
had 11
by 57
no 896
means 1
prepared 3
me 1041
for 484
what 14
I 4330
saw 24
That 11
of 109
Jonas 1
Ramus 0
which 2
is 124
perhaps 1
the 193
most 3
circumstantial 2
of 109
any 17
cannot 1
impart 8
the 193
faintest 1
conception 4
either 1
of 109
the 193
magnificence 2
or 333
of 109
the 193
horror 3
of 109
the 193
scene 5
or 333
of 109
the 193
wild 36
bewildering 2
sense 8
of 109
the 193
novel 22
which 2
confounds 1
the 193
beholder 3
I 4330
am 392
not 85
sure 11
from 2
what 14
point 22
of 109
view 18
the 193
writer 3
in 2719
question 16
surveyed 1
it 67
nor 102
at 272
what 14
time 45
but 82
it 67
could 2
neither 1
have 11
been 1
from 2
the 193

There 21
are 12
some 30
passages 1

description 3
nevertheless 1
which 2
may 49
be 1200
quoted 1
for 484
their 2
details 1
although 1
their 2
effect 15
is 124
exceedingly 1
feeble 5
in 2719
conveying 1
an 970
impression 12
of 109
the 193
spectacle 4
Between 1
Lofoden 0

he 962
says 1
the 193
depth 3

on 86
the 193

this 6
depth 3
decreases 1
so 797
as 509
not 85
to 805
afford 6
a 6799
convenient 2
passage 6
for 484
a 6799
vessel 3
without 1
the 193
risk 11
of 109
splitting 3
on 86
the 193

happens 4
even 36
in 2719
the 193
calmest 1

When 6

the 193
roar 9
of 109
its 2
impetuous 4
ebb 5
to 805
the 193

scarce 6

that 11
if 8
a 6799

comes 4
within 3
its 2

it 67
is 124
inevitably 1
absorbed 1

carried 1
down 90

the 193

when 6

But 82
these 4

only 1
at 272

The 193
attempts 1
to 805
account 14
for 484
the 193
phenomenon 3
some 30
of 109
which 2
I 4330
remember 4
seemed 1
to 805
me 1041
sufficiently 1
plausible 1
in 2719
perusal 3
now 10
wore 1
a 6799
very 1
different 11
and 51
unsatisfactory 1
aspect 3
The 193
idea 21
generally 1
received 1
is 124
that 11
this 6
as 509
well 24
as 509
three 12
smaller 1
vortices 0
among 1
the 193
Ferroe 0
islands 1
have 11
no 896
other 5
cause 14
than 22
the 193
collision 3
of 109
waves 1
rising 3
and 51
falling 1
at 272
flux 5
and 51
reflux 0
against 1
a 6799
ridge 7
of 109
rocks 1
and 51
shelves 1
which 2
confines 1
the 193
water 88
so 797
that 11
it 67
precipitates 1
itself 1
like 22
a 6799
cataract 3
and 51
thus 1
the 193
higher 2
the 193
flood 20
rises 1
the 193
deeper 1
must 28
the 193
fall 29
be 1200
and 51
the 193
natural 18
result 8
of 109
all 162
is 124
a 6799
whirlpool 3
or 333
vortex 3
the 193
prodigious 2
suction 5
of 109
which 2
is 124
sufficiently 1
known 1
by 57
lesser 1
experiments 1
These 4
are 12
the 193
words 5
of 109
the 193
Encyclopaedia 0
Britannica 2
Kircher 0
and 51
others 1
imagine 3
that 11
in 2719
the 193
centre 0
of 109
the 193
channel 11
of 109
the 193
Maelstr 4

somewhat 2
decidedly 1
named 4
in 2719
one 19
instance 4
This 6
opinion 4
idle 10
in 2719
itself 1
was 93
the 193
one 19
to 805
which 2
as 509
I 4330
gazed 1
my 90
imagination 3
most 3
readily 1
assented 1
and 51
mentioning 1
it 67
to 805
the 193
guide 16
I 4330
was 93
rather 2
surprised 1
to 805
hear 76
him 9
say 7
that 11
although 1
it 67
was 93
the 193
view 18
almost 1
universally 1
entertained 1
of 109
the 193
subject 11
by 57
the 193
Norwegians 1
it 67
nevertheless 1
was 93
not 85
his 43
own 9
As 509
to 805
the 193
former 3
notion 5
he 962
confessed 2
his 43
inability 2
to 805
comprehend 4
it 67
and 51
here 31
I 4330
agreed 1
with 34
him 9
for 484
however 1
conclusive 4
on 86
paper 35
it 67
becomes 1
altogether 1
unintelligible 1
and 51
even 36
absurd 9
amid 5
the 193
thunder 32
of 109
the 193
abyss 8
You 29
have 11
had 11
a 6799
good 28
look 14

I 4330
will 39
tell 16
you 29
a 6799
story 13
that 11
will 39
convince 3
you 29
I 4330

Myself 1
and 51
my 90
two 14

once 2
owned 1
a 6799

three 12
were 5
the 193
only 1
ones 2
who 79
made 13
a 6799
regular 13
business 13
of 109
going 3
out 365
to 805
the 193
islands 1
as 509
I 4330
tell 16
you 29
The 193
usual 3
grounds 10
are 12
a 6799
great 12
way 27

down 90

got 14
at 272

without 1
much 2
risk 11
and 51
therefore 1
these 4
places 1
are 12
preferred 1

however 1
not 85
only 1
yield 6
the 193
finest 1
variety 2
but 82
in 2719
far 91
greater 1
abundance 3
so 797
that 11
we 444
often 4
got 14
in 2719
a 6799
single 15
day 27
what 14
the 193
more 11
timid 8
of 109
the 193
craft 20
could 2
not 85
scrape 7
together 3
in 2719
a 6799
week 20
In 2719
fact 35
we 444
made 13
it 67
a 6799
matter 7
of 109
desperate 4
speculation 3
the 193
risk 11
of 109
life 44
standing 3
instead 1
of 109
labor 16
and 51
courage 6
answering 1
for 484
capital 17
We 444
kept 1
the 193
smack 8
in 2719
a 6799
cove 46
about 1
five 5
miles 4
higher 2
up 194
the 193
coast 14
than 22
this 6
and 51
it 67
was 93
our 3
practice 4
in 2719
fine 17
weather 33
to 805
take 18
advantage 6
of 109
the 193
fifteen 6
minutes' 0

across 1
the 193

far 91
above 3
the 193

then 5
drop 22
down 90
upon 1
anchorage 3
somewhere 1
near 15
Otterholm 0
or 333
Sandflesen 0
where 21
the 193
eddies 1
are 12
not 85
so 797
violent 2
as 509
elsewhere 1
Here 31
we 444
used 1
to 805
remain 9
until 1
nearly 1
time 45
for 484
slack 19
water 88
again 2
when 6
we 444
weighed 1
and 51
made 13
for 484
home 90
We 444
never 3
set 40
out 365
upon 1
this 6
expedition 4
without 1
a 6799
steady 3
side 74
wind 101
for 484
going 3
and 51
coming 3
one 19
that 11
we 444
felt 5
sure 11
would 5
not 85
fail 12
us 70
before 2
our 3
return 14
and 51
we 444
seldom 1
made 13
a 6799
mis 483
calculation 3
upon 1
this 6
point 22
Twice 1
during 1
six 24
years 1
we 444
were 5
forced 1
to 805
stay 7
all 162
night 61
at 272
anchor 21
on 86
account 14
of 109
a 6799
dead 39
calm 10
which 2
is 124
a 6799
rare 17
thing 15
indeed 1
just 24
about 1
here 31
and 51
once 2
we 444
had 11
to 805
remain 9
on 86
the 193
grounds 10
nearly 1
a 6799
week 20
starving 2
to 805
death 19
owing 1
to 805
a 6799
gale 6
which 2
blew 1
up 194
shortly 1
after 48
our 3
arrival 3
and 51
made 13
the 193
channel 11
too 50
boisterous 4
to 805
be 1200
thought 11
of 109
Upon 1
this 6
occasion 7
we 444
should 7
have 11
been 1
driven 1
out 365
to 805
sea 158
in 2719
spite 10
of 109
everything 2
for 484
the 193
whirlpools 1
threw 1
us 70
round 29
and 51
round 29
so 797
violently 1
that 11
at 272
length 14
we 444
fouled 1
our 3
anchor 21
and 51
dragged 1
it 67
if 8
it 67
had 11
not 85
been 1
that 11
we 444
drifted 1
into 26
one 19
of 109
the 193
innumerable 1
cross 74
currents 1
here 31
to 805
day 27
and 51
gone 4
to 805
morrow 3
which 2
drove 6
us 70
under 288
the 193
lee 29
of 109
Flimen 0
where 21
by 57
good 28
luck 14
we 444
brought 1
up 194
I 4330
could 2
not 85
tell 16
you 29
the 193
twentieth 3
part 102
of 109
the 193
difficulties 1
we 444
encountered 1
'on 0
the 193
grounds' 0
it 67
is 124
a 6799
bad 33
spot 24
to 805
be 1200
in 2719
even 36
in 2719
good 28
weather 33
but 82
we 444
made 13
shift 15
always 1
to 805
run 50
the 193
gauntlet 3
of 109
the 193
Moskoe 0
str 437
m 6769
itself 1
without 1
accident 7
although 1
at 272
times 10
my 90
heart 57
has 41
been 1
in 2719
my 90
mouth 22
when 6
we 444
happened 1
to 805
be 1200
a 6799
minute 12
or 333
so 797
behind 4
or 333
before 2
the 193
slack 19
The 193
wind 101
sometimes 1
was 93
not 85
as 509
strong 16
as 509
we 444
thought 11
it 67
at 272
starting 1
and 51
then 5
we 444
made 13
rather 2
less 19
way 27
than 22
we 444
could 2
wish 13
while 4
the 193
current 4
rendered 1
the 193
smack 8
unmanageable 1
My 90
eldest 1
brother 9
had 11
a 6799
son 70
eighteen 6
years 1
old 21
and 51
I 4330
had 11
two 14
stout 9
boys 4
of 109
my 90
own 9
These 4
would 5
have 11
been 1
of 109
great 12
assistance 2
at 272
such 2
times 10
in 2719
using 1
the 193
sweeps 3
as 509
well 24
as 509
afterward 2
in 2719
fishing 2
but 82
somehow 1
although 1
we 444
ran 110
the 193
risk 11
ourselves 1
we 444
had 11
not 85
the 193
heart 57
to 805
let 50
the 193
young 9
ones 2
get 13
into 26
the 193
danger 7
for 484
after 48
all 162
is 124
said 1
and 51
done 3
it 67
was 93
a 6799
horrible 3
danger 7
and 51
that 11
is 124
the 193
truth 7
It 67
is 124
now 10
within 3
a 6799
few 6
days 1
of 109
three 12
years 1
since 7
what 14
I 4330
am 392
going 3
to 805
tell 16
you 29
occurred 1
It 67
was 93
on 86
the 193
tenth 4
day 27
of 109
July 2
a 6799
day 27
which 2
the 193
people 4
of 109
this 6
part 102
of 109
the 193
world 12
will 39
never 3
forget 8
for 484
it 67
was 93
one 19
in 2719
which 2
blew 1
the 193
most 3
terrible 3
hurricane 3
that 11
ever 33
came 36
out 365
of 109
the 193
heavens 2
And 51
yet 4
all 162
the 193
morning 3
and 51
indeed 1
until 1
late 23
in 2719
the 193
afternoon 3
there 21
was 93
a 6799
gentle 18
and 51
steady 3
breeze 7
from 2
the 193
south 42
west 27
while 4
the 193
sun 130
shone 1
brightly 1
so 797
that 11
the 193
oldest 1
seaman 4
among 1
us 70
could 2
not 85
have 11
foreseen 1
what 14
was 93
to 805
follow 11
The 193
three 12
of 109
us 70
my 90
two 14
brothers 1
and 51
myself 1
had 11
crossed 1
over 596
to 805
the 193
islands 1
about 1
two 14
o'clock 1
P 8948
M 6769
and 51
had 11
soon 3
nearly 1
loaded 1
the 193
smack 8
with 34
fine 17
fish 46
which 2
we 444
all 162
remarked 1
were 5
more 11
plenty 2
that 11
day 27
than 22
we 444
had 11
ever 33
known 1
them 9
It 67
was 93
just 24
seven 18
by 57
my 90
watch 35
when 6
we 444
weighed 1
and 51
started 1
for 484
home 90
so 797
as 509
to 805
make 17
the 193
worst 6
of 109
the 193
Str 437
m 6769
at 272
slack 19
water 88
which 2
we 444
knew 1
would 5
be 1200
at 272
eight 18
We 444
set 40
out 365
with 34
a 6799
fresh 22
wind 101
on 86
our 3
starboard 2
quarter 25
and 51
for 484
some 30
time 45
spanked 1
along 3
at 272
a 6799
great 12
rate 9
never 3
dreaming 1
of 109
danger 7
for 484
indeed 1
we 444
saw 24
not 85
the 193
slightest 1
reason 13
to 805
apprehend 4
it 67
All 162
at 272
once 2
we 444
were 5
taken 1
aback 1
by 57
a 6799

had 11

and 51
I 4330
began 1
to 805
feel 11
a 6799
little 6
uneasy 1
without 1
exactly 1
knowing 3
why 4
We 444
put 47
the 193
boat 22
on 86

could 2
make 17
no 896
headway 2

was 93
upon 1
the 193
point 22
of 109
proposing 1
to 805
return 14
to 805
the 193
anchorage 3
when 6
looking 1
astern 1
we 444
saw 24
the 193
whole 26

covered 1
with 34
a 6799
singular 7
